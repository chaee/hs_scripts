Let's put it this way, your chances of the fire station being empty is by far greater than you will wait longer than 20 seconds to talk to a 911 dispatcher.   \n\nAnd FWIW your are correct that the response time clock for first responders begins ticking when the call is answered.\n\n911 call handling and dispatch is tracked differently.\n\nI think NAFPA says medical and fire calls are to be dispatched within 60 seconds of picking up the phone 90 percent of the time.  This is a lot quicker than having just a 60 second average. \n\nThen a tougher time standard kicks in,, first responders are supposed to be enroute within 6o seconds of the alarm activating.  Fire misses this standard a bit,, AMR which tends to have crews standing-by in their rigs, is in compliance.\n\nAMR gets fined not being in compliance,,,nothing happens to Fire.\nI'm not sure at this moment \n\nBOEC also has goals for emergency police call handling, but I will abstain from any further remarks about these til I confirm those goals.

But you can't leave money out of the overall picture, JRN.  Many people make an enjoyable, honest living outfitting and guiding tourists and locals in Alaska public lands.

What you have with guns and suicidal individuals is a combination that ups the likelihood of death.  \n\nFirst off, self-inflicted gunshot wounds are the most effective ways of killing oneself.  A Harvard study from 2001 found that 85% of those who attempted suicide this way were successful.  Suffocation (hanging) came in second at 69%.  All other methods were well below 50%.\n\nSecond the availability of guns increases the likelihood of attempting suicide.  It's quick and requires little pre-planning.  Guns play an outsized role in spontaneous suicides.  Someone in a momentary crisis situation with a tendency toward depression and perhaps under the influence of alcohol or drugs grabs a gun and it's over.  A noose requires work,  other means lead to prolonged periods between initiating the attempt and death, which gives time for an intervention or for the suicidal person to seek help.\n\n2/3 of our gun deaths are suicides.  It's not anti-gun to acknowledge this and seek to fix it.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

The main reason for a probationary period for a 'new hire' is to determine whether the new person fits in with the organization or not.   When I hired, I always assumed the person could do the job; otherwise why would I hire them?  If they couldn't do the job, they would soon be gone.   The same is true of being the new person being hired.\n\nAfter that, personality, work style, and work ethic are always important.  If the organization is a 'nose to the grindstone' 'get the work done no matter what' organization, the 'laid back' person is not going to work out even if the measureable results at the end are identical.  The reverse is true, as well. \n\nI have seen turnover that happened just because of those issues.  The election of J. Pat Horton as DA back in the 70's resulted in the replacement of about half the existing staff here in the Lane County DA's office in about 6 months.   They were all competent but he wanted a particular style in his office and he got it.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

This has already been discussed here: An anti-bark collar is not an electronic fence collar. And nothing in the article suggests either the electronic fence or the electronic collar was malfunctioning. If you read the article you will note that in 2015 his anti-bark collar had a dead battery, which lead to him barking at somebody and so the original complaint. \n\nThat has nothing to do with an electronic fence collar in 2016. The collars that go with electronic fences normally are NOT anti-bark and for good reason -- you don't want the dog confused over whether he is getting shocked because he is close to the boundary or because he is barking. I know because I have both collars for my dogs and I need to choose which one they wear.\n\nYes indeed he was barking because he did not have his bark collar on.

Hi Jeff. The state's administrative costs associated with the Oregon 529 program come from a .05 percent management fee that is assessed on accounts. Thus, investors are paying for the costs of the program. \n\nThere is a value to investors when marketing efforts are successful: More investors and more assets under management allow the management fee percentage to be reduced. (A decade ago, investors in the 529 plan paid .1 percent to cover administrative and marketing costs. As the total assets under management grew, that percentage was able to be cut in half).

You are correct - but if things are going to change some of those officers are going to have to stand up and speak out regardless of the personal cost.  \nLook back on most improvement in workforce conditions, or on the exposure and remediation of many seriously corrupt, self protecting systems and situations - reform usually starts with individuals of *inside experience and documentation [or fellow witnesses]* who are willing to risk it all and speak out - loudly and persistently.  True, whistle-blowers usually suffer personally and professionally.  \nI point out that this situation differs little from that in AST for decades - Troopers who speak out against corrupt practices are also likely to lose very hard.

perspective is power. We have the largest state with the widest districts and some of the most remote schools on earth. Add that to the large number of English as a second language homes and all the recent school fires.

Tell me how does one meet the federal requirements for education for a village with 9 children without spending plane loads of money sending equipment and paying individuals to stay in those remote locations? A teacher in town teaches 35 per class times 6 or 7 classes of kids weekly, one in the village sees a handful all day but by contract gets the same pay.

Norway took our creative PFD model, then tweaked it to fit their opportunities and needs.

"Are you aware that the Congress, bending to the lobbying of ultra conservatives, is grossly underfunding our national parks to the tune of $12 BILLION  in backlogged maintenance because, as the Conservatives tell them, the national parks are a drain on America's budget and should be self sustaining financially.  They continue to urge Congress, instead, to give industry ""leases"" to extract the natural resources of our park which would then be used to ""maintain"" the parks (in a vastly diminished if not completely compromised, manner).

Correction:  The UTSA numbers were total expenditures, while those provided for UA were state appropriated funds.  I was able to find the total revenue (state, tuition, fed, etc.) for UAA FY 15. It is $309 million.  Assuming that no money from FY15 was returned and with 20,000 students, this makes the cost of education at UAA $15,500 per student. The cost-of-living adjusted number between ANC and SA is $10,000 per student. Using UAF's FY14 numbers, $459 million with 10,000 students, you get $46,000 per student (COL adjusted = $29,000). Combining UAA and UAF, you get $25,600 per student (COL adjusted = $16,400). I stand by my conclusion that these campuses are operating efficiently. I won't weigh in on statewide administration.

"Sanders cannot ""deliver"" his supporters, we will make our own decisions. I'm sure he will endorse Clinton and maybe even campaign for her in some fashion but a lot of us won't buy it.  He will remain a strong voice for the left and will continue to push the Democrats to the left -- with what success I can't predict but they would be smart to listen to him, and to his supporters. This revolt has been coming on for a long time, Sanders didn't invent it.\n\nI think part of his lasting impact will be the huge email list he has accumulated and the movement his campaign has given a huge boost to. He has proven that you can run for president without taking money from rich people, if enough people want what you want. The same thing can be done in other campaigns, so I think we will see a decline in the influence of money on politics.

I grew up in Oregon when the previous generations still believed in funding schools and colleges so the next generations could become more educated than the last.  If Oregonians would actually step up and fund Public education at the levels prior to Measure 5 we would attract and retain more highly educated individuals in education from K-12 and into Higher Educations.  Unfortunately, Oregon has fallen to 46th for High School graduation in our nation due to reduced school funding; Oregon once had some of the top schools in the nation because we believed in funding education separately from the General Fund.  Once we start funding education to the levels where we can retain great teachers in Math, Sciences, Language Arts, Literature, Vocational Arts, Genera Arts, etc., we will begin the climb back to the top in education nationally.\n\nLook around the world and see the many countries surpassing the US in education, it's because they know the value of funding education.

Actually, the real cause of these road ruts, which I suspect are responsible for MANY accidents on Anchorage area roads and highways, is the insanity of allowing cars to drive with studded tires, which tear up any road surface, particularly asphalt, and which have long been illegal almost everywhere outside Alaska for precisely that reason.  \n\nI have spoken to DOT personnel and engineers who estimate that 90 to 95% of the road wear on Anchorage streets and roads is due to studs alone.  This effectively costs the municipality, and the state, tens of MILLIONS of dollars annually in repairs.  And who knows how many have been injured, or died, due to accidents caused the hydroplaning after rain has filled the ruts?  I have often been forced to drive on the Glenn Highway during or after a heavy rain while offset in my lane to avoid the water-filled ruts, making for an unsafe situation for myself and others, but not nearly as unsafe as losing control due to hydroplaning.

I state all this from experience, but the best thing is to find a really competent FFL holder and question him or her. But read up on the BATFE site first. Hope this helps."

Mr. Saylor:\nYour points are well taken. Many people question the effectiveness of our education system in Alaska. It does not produce stellar performance by many measures when looking at money spent. Despite that, the past administrations and legislatures have underfunded education budgets which has not helped to produce the kind of students you and I want. The suggested fix: An Education Czar who oversees all of the school districts to ensure that all districts are receiving equitable funding regardless of where they are; setting performance guidelines that must be achieved to avoid having their school system taken over by the Education Czar; ensure that all teachers are qualified in the area that they are teaching; ensure that all schools lower their turnover rates; set measurable acceptable guidelines for reducing dropouts; and produce students that are college or voc/tech ready.

Actually look at it like this. The oil industry is in a slump in Alaska. They say give us everything we want or else. And if you do we will be right back when things get better. So we rob our savings account (including dividends) create what we are thinking is a temporary income tax and wait. And things get better but hey the oil industry has never lived to us. (Right) So like Detroit and other cities and states they never come to save the day. Difference is Detroit waited too long. Could not recover. Just kept taxing. Industries don't like runaway taxes. So they don't want to open their doors there. Other places learned and realized they needed to diversify their economy create opportunities. Don't create stop gap methods.

They depend on the police now and have really no other means of protection until somebody with a uniform doesn't arrive in time.

I share your opinion on this, Roy. Poor people are denied bail or stuck in halfway houses at the mercy of a profiteering corporation that makes a great deal of money for holding them. It pays staff so little, that people who shouldn't be trusted with flipping burgers are put in charge of people's lives. Most, if not all the halfway houses are entirely owned by GEO Group, which I believe is as larcenous as any thief sitting in prison. They are the direct and cultural heirs of Bill Weimar and Frank Prewitt, who created this enormous scam in Alaska, propelled by illegal campaign contributions and outright bribes. If they those charged demanded the speedy trials to which they are constitutionally entitled, it would put an end to jail overcrowding, but public defenders urge them to waive time, which allows many to be kept for years, awaiting trial, until even the innocent are sometimes willing to plead guilty  in order to just get out with time served.

Let's just do a hypothetical then.  A quick look through staff directories suggests that by consolidating functions, half the admin staff in two of the four districts could be eliminated.  Looks like that would total maybe 20 people island-wide depending on how you define administration (are facility maintenance people 'administration'?).  \n\nLet's estimate that each body costs $100K with benefits (probably high, some are part time most likely).  That comes to $2M.  The total state POW budget is around $16M.  So that saves 12.5%.  Not bad, though it does leave 20 people unemployed on the island, which is a pretty big hit.  \n\nSo how do we get to the remaining 37.5% reduction?  Starts getting a lot harder, doesn't it?

AKfox: While you are surely entitled to your opinion, I believe you have misinterpreted the law. The 1998 vote was advisory: not a law.

Don't misunderstand me; I'm a libertarian and disapprove of all this spending, however historically, the voters have supported all this government to the point that people are going to get hurt one way or another.\n\nIf the veto decision does nothing else, it inspires a debate which is long overdue!\n\nFor what it is worth, I voted with a majority of other Alaskans in 1976 to establish this fund to support state spending when oil revenues ran dry; there was no dividend program at that time.\n\nThis is the political season: please exercise your rights and use the process to forward your views.

Eric, You seem to see everything in money terms so let’s look at some figures. The average cost of raising a child born in 2013 up until age 18 for a middle family in the U.S. is approximately $245K.  Average cost of imprisonment in Hawaii $43.070 a year, times 18 years, $775K, this does not include all the police, court and other fees.  The annual cost of, permanent housing, ranges from $13K to $25K per person, $360K over 18 years at $20K/year. In Hawaii, on an annual salary of $30K, federal and state taxes are about $6500 per year until 65, that’s about $300K, not to mention sales, vat and others. the cost of raising the mother and child to 18 is $605K, subtract the taxes he will pay over a 40-year work span and the total outlay is $305K. Doing nothing can cost much more in incarceration, lost taxes and the probability that he, or she, will create more dysfunctional kids, perpetuating this problem. the cost is at least twice as much by not fixing it up front.

As a firearm user/owner since I was about 5, most of these proposals make sense. And in fact most firearm owners (definitely not all) I talk to are all for universal background checks. Very few people with average common sense want convicted felons to be able to walk into gun shows and purchase firearms with zero background check required. Which is the case right now. I've seen some really shady characters at gun shows, people that if  I knew they lived in my neighborhood, I definitely wouldn't want owning firearms. That said, trying to ban semi-automatic weapons is what scares most in the firearm community, and politicians/citizens who are uneducated about firearms need to realize this: semi-automatic firearms encompass a huge variety of weapons, many used for hunting and sport. Trying to ban them is ridiculous. Stop with that rhetoric, and instead focus solely on common sense things like universal background checks, and we might make progress on this.

Thank you Mark. This is, though, sort of what I was responding to in Ixtlan's posts--I am Jewish, but I don't practice the religion. I'm an agnostic (my personal belief is that there might or might not be a God or gods, but that we do not--and probably cannot--know). So not all Jews believe in God--a great many don't--but they're still Jewish. \n\nYet though I don't attend synagogue or believe in the Hebrew God, I still practice some of the rituals, like lighting candles on Chanukah or gathering for a seder on Passover. I am also a product of Jewish culture, which in America includes a spectrum of beliefs but has a common ancestry, a shared history (mostly of persecution) and some general values, such as an emphasis on academic success, tenacity in the face of adversity and a good sense of humor.

"Ranting about third parties is what Americans do because they're too lazy to actually participate in the current two-party system which ISN'T GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON. Participation means being active members of a party and engaging in party politics. It's not rocket science folks it's just having the balls to participate in and reform political institutions. There will always be a new batch of novices, however, who will go through the oft trodden path of learning the hard way about third parties. Americans have never been fast learners when it comes to politics and they want easy answers to difficult problems. In short, they have a tiny attention span and low political intelligence for the most part.

Brain research provides clues. *""Out-of-body"" experiences can be duplicated by brain stimulation. *Some of the Biblical descriptions of ""visions and messages from a god"" are similar to typical epileptic seizures (seeing white light, auditory hallucinations, etc). *""Returning from the dead"" is now being examined with attention to the various phases through which a body dies. Dying is is a series of shut-downs and can sometimes be reversed before the actual final closure.

Finish the rail means we must build rail all the way to UH at a minimum.

Sean your just like Jim putting your spin on facts. State land does not cut 22 miles into the Park.  The park boarders three sides of State land. That is why they are called boundaries. I believe all the national parks in Alaska are not square boxes or straight lines of boundaries. Land inside are park and land outside is not! Again why there were more wolf sightings during the closed hunting time, was because ungulate were at their peek and as those populations declined, so did the wolf population. At the same time, the document cases of pack territory fights increase, with more wolf killing each other, and leaving the park permanently  than any recorded take of wolves by hunters and trappers.

Now, it is true that any member of the cat family can shed oocysts, and this includes native cats such as bobcat, lynx, puma, and jaguar.  But since the combined population of these native cats comprises only about 2% of the total number of cats nationwide -- and there are NONE in hawaii -- and since most human-populated areas have almost zero native cats living among people, the source of oocyst contamination is almost exclusively domestic house-cat.  In Hawaii, it is exclusively domestic house-cats.  \n\nEnvironmental contamination of oocysts is so pervasive in areas with high concentrations of cats that scientists fear toxoplasmosis infections may become almost impossible to avoid.  Toxoplasmosis is now being linked to Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, autism, depression, suicide, OCD and more.  There is no vaccine and no cure for toxoplasmosis.

"""There is no way to spin away the fact that this tax will hurt Oregon corporations and the Oregon economy.""\n\nThat's not a fact, it's an opinion.  M97 will raise taxes on _some_ Oregon C corporations -- not nonprofits, not pass-throughs, not proprietors.  Those same corporations used to pay a lot more in taxes than they do now.  Why shouldn't Umpqua, using your example, pay 5 percent of _net_ income to support the Oregon economy.  That doesn't sound outrageous to me, bearing in mind that their senior management team probably takes home more than $12 million in bonuses and perks.  \n\nKendall will probably eat some of the tax and pass along some of it.  I'm not concerned that the cost of cars will go up 1.25 percent (if they pass along half).  Who would notice?\n\nGrocers are another story.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's a proposal next February to reduce the M97 tax on food to help that industry.  M97 is just the first step in building an adequately funded education system."

From a scientific and not legal or political point of  view, the male brain is not mature enough for full decision making until about 22. For girls it is slightly earlier, except in this lady's brain it obviously didn't mature. In any case, scientifically and psychologically speaking, no 16 year old can really consent because their brains simply lack the same decision making capacity as an adult. I work with young adults, at risk youth, and have a science and psychology degree,  I have seen the negative impacts of adult women preying on teenagers, it happens frequently and is often underreported in our society, and these youth have serious issues later because the relationship with a cougar is often an abusive and controlling one. I see the after effects, and it is anything but arbitrary.

Every parent to be makes the choice they feel is in the best interest for the unborn baby, the children and family they already have. Having a child with extreme medical needs is a huge commitment and impacts every aspect of the entire household. Life simply does not stop when one child needs special and frequent medical care. The other children still have to be fed, clothed, taken to school, sports, music & helped with homework. Middle of the night ER visits and hospital stays affect the whole family. Not every parent is able to handle a child with special medical needs. If the parent becomes unable to cope with their grief, then you risk losing that parent as well. As a parent, we wish we could magically protect our children from pain. Even when treatment is medically necessary, it is always  heartbreaking to watch your child suffer. Not choosing to proceed takes love, strength and courage. There isn't an easy or simple answer, both have pain & love that last forever. Prayers 4 Sky.

There is a lot of information available online on homelessness, both local and national. We know a lot about causes, what works and what doesn't.

"Snowman,  I first arrived in Fairbanks in 1967, my uncle Ernie was there since ww2...  many of the oldtimers in Fairbanks were talking very loudly about building a gasline down from the Nsloppy since the early 1950's. During the past 2-centuries there was plenty of gas & messy oil all over the place between Barrow & Kaktovik & Tuktoyaktuk. The Newsminer has many old articles discussing a gasline in the 1950's. Katalla Oil was Alaska's first oil-company established 100 years ago, some of the grandkids still talk of a statewide gasline network. How hard was it to build the fuel-pipeline from Haines to Eielson??  In 1970 at UAF we discussed building a gasline from Deadhorse to Fairbanks to provide fuel-energy for the TAPS project, this was the original thinking behind the existing 140mi 10""-12"" fuelgasline that terminates at PS4-Galbraith.

Interesting comment.  The abhorence in this case is directed at the largest tenants of the largest property owner on the island, the Molokai Ranch.

The issue was originally anything GMO but that got little traction on agricultural Molokai so pesticides are now the issue. \nMOM was spearheaded by non other than Mercy Ritte.

You're suggesting Djou was going through the motions as the committee chair.  NO, Choon.  Djou started advocating for the creation of HART before the public rail vote in 2008.  You're definitely blinding yourself to the power of a committee chair to oppose a bill, bottle up a bill, etc.  Instead, Djou championed creating HART and gave it a blank check, zero oversight, and the predetermined authority under the City Charter to build 34-miles of rail.  How Djou conned you and Cayetano and others into thinking that either he or anyone could defy the City Charter provision establishing HART is beyond me.

Years ago I wrote to then Gov. Lingle recommending she consider and support creating retirement communities similar to Florida on the outer islands. At the time the UH had completed their medical educational facility in Kakaako. The type of jobs that would support such an endeavor would generate employment opportunities for the graduates that could help keep them in Hawaii. The additional professional jobs required in support of this, such as infrastructure development and quality of life sustainment would benefit all the outer islands and address other issues concerning Hawaii's elderly. Her response was disheartening, she replied that ongoing development at Ko Olina and aqua farming on the Big Isle were helping to address employment issues for Hawaii. Note not only did she miss the point ( completely) but she did not mention anything about benefits coming off of Mauna Kea.  The plantation era as with tourism today provide jobs.

It reported that it unanimously agreed that found no biblical or Sister White prohibition for ordaining women to the ministry of the Seventh-day Adventist church.   \n\nThe church has never voted otherwise.\n\nOn the basis of this unanimous finding the committee proposed to the SA General Conference to delegate to the Divisions when and how to implement women's ordination in their territory based on cultural implications locally.\n\nThe SA vote rejected Divisions being delegated this responsibility.   \n\nThis report describes the current GC leadership's attempt to reclaim authority from Unions in all matters ecclesiastical.

After Reagans tax cuts, I had a neighbor who owned 3 separate houses for the mortgage interest deductions and lived in a rental, next door to me. He was really upset with Reagan when the cuts went into effect because the mortgage interest rules changed. He could no longer deduct the 3rd mortgage fully, and could only deduct a percentage of the 2nd mortgage. While his tax rate went down, his tax liability went way up and he hated Reagan for it. That was happening to a very large number of the wealthy. Your opinion about the rich paying less is false. As is your assertion that comparing the tax burden and the actual amount of taxes paid is comparing apples and oranges. If they are paying more taxes due to changes in deductions and that shows that the wealthy are paying a greater share of the tax burden is not a comparison of apples and oranges.

"Your contrasting ""objective sin"" with sin as a construct is confusing and not entirely correct.  \n\nFirst of all, there IS ""objective sin,"" or what St. Thomas calls ""material sin.""  It is not the kind of sin that brings moral guilt, and is not what most people think of when they think of sin.  \n\nSecondly, you are right to say that sin as we usually mean it --- ""actual"" sin --- is subjective, in that it requires the actor's knowledge of the wrongness of the act and the intent to commit it.  Your phrasing, however, invites the conclusion that nothing is objectively wrong, which I don't think you really want to say.\n\nFinally, to say there is ""only a construct of sin"" seems to say that sin does not exist except as a creation of the human mind.

Not only did Ruedrich claim that 13 Shungnak voters actually would have voted on the Republican ballot if they were only allowed to have one ballot, he also claimed that of those 13 unidentified voters who really wanted to vote the Republican ballot, only one actually cast a vote for the Republican caucus' hand-picked candidate and 12 of those would-be Republican ballot voters voted for the opponent of the Republican caucus' darling.  That's a bit laughable.  Also, Mr. Ruedrich based his assertion of the number of voters who would have selected the Republican ballot in part on the hotly contested 2010 Republican primary, where there was a close race for U.S. Senate, which likely drew people to vote the Republican ballot.  Such was not the case in 2016, however.  I find Ruedrich's claims flawed and specious.	[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021
AND, Fox News added these details....timely details:\n\nThe Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York said Thursday that it has created a compensation program for people who were sexually abused by priests or deacons and are willing to forego lawsuits in exchange for an award to be determined by an independent mediator.\n\nSome advocates for sex abuse victims immediately assailed the program as an attempt to squash cases quickly, before New York's legislature acts on a proposal to make it easier for victims to sue over abuse that happened years ago.\n\nUnder the plan, announced by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, people with abuse claims already pending with the church would have a limited time window -- until Jan. 31 -- to apply for compensation.\n\nThe archdiocese said it had hired mediators Camille Biros and Kenneth Feinberg to evaluate the claims and decide how much victims would be paid.

We know that if Murkowski is reelected and Republicans hold the Senate then the gridlock will continue. With an Independent Margaret Stock in the Senate she may be able to work with the party that has the best ideas for improving the state of the nation. At this point that party is without a doubt the Democratic Party but maybe not to her. In order to be the change you want to see you need to vote for change. Look at all the candidates closely and you will see that only one can be independent of the party structure that Lisa will never be able to break free of. The McConnell caucus is rigid in it's demands to obstruct whatever the POTUS proposes.

Two situations are at play ; One is that liberals organize letter to the editor campaigns to make it appear everyone , and I mean everyone agree's with them---when they don't.   Don Young is trashed non-stop in the letter section and the paper only writes negative stuff about him . Judging from all those letters and stories one would be tricked into thinking everyone hates him and that he's Hitler's brother . Yet the people always vote for him.   The second is , conservatives don't engage in phony letter to the editor schemes . They go to work each day , pay their taxes , and take care of their families. They mostly keep their opinions to themselves . That is why you see so few conservative letters to the editor. When you do see a conservative letter to the editor you know it's sincere and not written by some group urging it's members to flood the paper with letters to the editor.

Let me count the ways;\n\n(1) Felis catus is a selectively-bred, ruthlessly culled, debased, domesticated animal that NEVER existed in nature.  Definitely NOT non-GMO.\n(2) Proof is that it has driven its own wild forebear F. sylvestris to the very brink of extinction by displacing it through human-engendered superior numbers, infecting it with FIV and other domesticated feline diseases and genetically swamping it--there are only 19 F. sylvestris left in the UK.  They're already extinct.  They just don't know it yet.\n(3) F. catus is physically smaller, has significantly reduced cranial capacity and is therefore less intelligent and more dependent, less territorial, breeds 3-4 times more often, and has a significantly longer gut (an adaptation for human-proffered low protein diets) than its wild ancestor. \n\n(CONTINUED BELOW):	[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

It's the fuel that powers the economic engine.  Engines function when fuel is channeled, regulated and burned under controlled conditions, mixed with the air of labor and consumption and fired at the correct timing and cycle of pistons and valves.\nConservatism allows greed freedom from control, like throwing a match into a gallon of gas.

"Greg, seems like the analyses I've seen of BC's carbon tax consumption effect have only shown data through 2012, which is why I used 2012 as the base value.  If you use 2011 as the base, then through 2015 gross sales of gasoline have increased 15.6% in BC vs. 6% in Canada overall, although the latter figure would be slightly lower if BC wasn't included (as you point out).  I don't know why net sales of gasoline is more relevant than gross sales, since they define gross sales as ""total sales of all road grades of gasoline for all uses, including off-road activities such as farming, forestry, construction or mining.""  It doesn't say anything about exports but correct me if I'm wrong.  Otherwise you might be cherry picking a bit yourself?

Sorry Mr. Bob, I have you confused with the Bob Atkinson who lives in Anchorage and is a drifter in Bristol Bay. My bad. Rep. Stutes from Kodiak, home to one of the world's largest seafood ports, chaired the House Fisheries committee and basically sat on the commercial fish tax proposal, effectively killing it for the session. Has nothing to do with being a Republican or Democrat. And I am right about the Governor's Bill. \n\nSee Bob, no matter who is in control of the Legislature, the commercial fishing tax structure is rigged to pay the minimal amount of fish taxes to Alaska and extract as much money from the state to subsidize commercial fishing infrastructure and management costs. \n\nFirst, only the ex-vessel value is taxed, not the export value. That means $4 billion of natural resource leaves Alaska without being taxed. Second, fish taxes are shared split with coastal communities, like Kodiak, even though they don't have a skin in covering the management expenses. The fix is in.

You guys are something else. Where you get the stones to point your finger at Trump and accuse him of something that your own candidate is guilty of is just stunning. This type of progressive lunacy is the exact reason can never be trusted in positions of power or authority over other people no matter what.  You have no scruples, no moral compass, no ethical boundaries. Lying and cheating are just fine if it gets us what we want.

Granting the premise--climate change is the most crucial issue facing humanity at this time--who exactly ought to be raising this issue, who is guilty for fact it is not a significant election issue?\n\nNot the candidates and their campaigns, for as Elagabalus says, we know that Trump is nuts on this issue as well as many others, so the only rational vote on this issue is Clinton. Given the absurd nature of this campaign, I wouldn't expect her to go there. \n\nThe US Converence of Catholic Bishops, on the other hand, they should be blamed for not raising this issue as a factor. Because it is urgently relevant to an honest preoccupation with life. Because the universal Church has declared it the issue of our time. Because the bishops focus on abortion inclines those who care what the bishops think to vote for Trump and his party, who are on record as standing four square against trying to save our bacon on climate change.\n\nMay God have mercy on their anti-salvation stance.

Craig is therefore speaking to the merits and definitionally not making a strawman argument.  \n\nYou have consistently spoken and written against attempts by the Native Hawaiian community to better their conditions.  You don't seem to include advocating that non-white Kingdom land-owners should also turn over all their lands to the State for the benefit of all.  Rather, as you state here, Hawaiians contributed all the land to Hawaii's modern melting pot (however unwillingly).  Yet they are the most dispossessed from that land today.  It would be great if your principled stands for equality actually sought equality.  Instead, your post-racial analysis seems comfortable with Native Hawaiians' depressed conditions in the State today and in your twisted version of ""equality"", you seek to rip from them any resources available to address those conditions."

What I've found happening a lot lately is that people feel like feelings and ignorance are better guides to God's will than study and scholarship. The scholar, in fact, is probably wrong precisely because he's a scholar, while the ignorant man, exercising his gut instincts, somehow discerns the truth of God. This is happening in the politics of both our nation and our church. There are texts you could interpret both ways. Paul himself was a scholar, but then there are passages like 1 Corinthians 1:20, that could make you wonder if Paul felt the same way about knowledge, and preferred ignorance.

Obama and Democrats while the GOP is given a free ride as if they have no complicity in it.  How come?  Another issue is the desire to see a total break-up of the power of Washington and so many went for the outsider (without any realization that they were actually voting-in a single party rule that has always damaged democracy before) in the hope that it would ""shake up"" the federal government (as if Giuliani, Christie, Pence, McConnell and Ryan were somehow ""new"").

The economic model Trump seems to favor -- which sounds like the widely disparaged trickle down Austerity economics of Reagan times, as well as more recently in Europe, is one which has been widely disproved. But people seem ever to believe in it, because it appears to make sense from the point of view of a family budget. But it doesn't from a societal scale, because you have to have extra funds to create more funds . . . so it has never worked! It is actually ok and healthy to work with some debt. We have tried the other guy -- Reagan for one -- and it did not work! Never has. Ask Nobel Laureate economist Dr. Paul Krugman, who has great NYTimes columns. Democrats have greatly reduced the national debt in several of the latest presidencies -- Clinton and Obama in particular. It has been the GOP which have hugely expanded the debt.

1/ I never claimed to be an orthodox Catholic; quite the contrary. I'm a cradle Catholic who left the church as a teenager and was atheist for the better part of my life. Some years ago I had some religious experiences. (Pretty stock religious experiences, as it turns out.) So I reconsidered atheism and after much vacillation and with many reservations I returned to the church. I was raised to think it was the desire to follow Jesus that foremost defines a Christian. I was always a Christ-lover (whoever He was). Of course the church doesn't approve of arriving at Christianity through mysticism, because there's no inevitability between theism and Christianity.

Aside from its traditional meaning, 'Church Militant' has become a code word for an ugly strain of intolerance in the name of what you term faux-traditionalist Catholicism.

As for the allegations of antisemitism, etc., they seem to stem more from comments others have made on the Bretibart site than those of Bannon himself, the implication being that his failure to refute or remove such comments suggests personal consent.\n\nI withhold judgment on all that, but I have learned enough about the man to believe he's unqualified to be a presidential counselor.

When people look for racism they find it.  This is true.  Every time it has been studied in a systematic, scientific way racism has been found.  Read a book.  It's a big problem and sweeping it under the rug with platitudes doesn't help.  Employers are more likely to call a white person with a criminal record back for another interview than blacks with no criminal record.  Other experiments have revealed that simply having a black sounding name vs a white sounding name on fictitious, identical  resumes results in fewer job offers.  Black children are subjected to punishment more often and more severe punishments than their white counterparts.  Note: I am talking about experiments where all other factors are carefully controlled, although there is plenty of real-world evidence that blacks are treated unjustly.

I was a federal classification officer in Ottawa during Trudeau 1.0's time and I am well aware of how these things work.  Most federal employees such as the ones who adoringly mobbed Junior at Global Affairs HQ shortly after he was elected vote Liberal because they know this is their best way to maintain and enhance their exorbitant and privileged status compared with their market sector counterparts.

Lots of people in the US take advantage of this. Also, I know as a fact from my military service that many of the country people from México and Central American countries are more socially conservative in comparison to most Americans, and if Republicans could get over their melaninophobia, they would see people who are hard working, church-going, and family oriented. If more conservatives/Republicans volunteered in organizations that handle refugees (think: helping to teach people English), they would have an opportunity to learn first-hand about these people's values as well as show them the opportunity they can have without people with leftist views inculcating them into a position of dependent victim-hood.

This fact differs from your suggestion that the internet is presenting arguments that God's favor does not reside with Witnesses.\n \nYour dogmatic comments do not align with scripture.  For example, your comment ""GOD would not get things wrong like too many end of world predictions to count.""  God was not the interpreter, men were.

Neither you nor this organization defines when the right time is for men to understand everything correctly.

What is even more atrocious, 1982 was a bad year to retire, close to the worst, 1981.The purchasing power of the pension is affected by the method of calculating the pension.  Using the gov’t plan as an example, where 30 years employment results in a “60%” pension. For 1981 retirees, its purchasing power was 44% of the purchasing power of average salary in the last 5 years of employment. This is due to misuse of arithmetic in “averaging”. According to federal Treasury Board ALL pension plans use that same technique.  So retirees  this year, public or private, with 30 years employment, will receive pensions with 57% purchasing power.  \n\nSo the pension industry does not discriminate. All pensioners, public and private sector, lose.  All employers, taxpayers and employers in the private sector gain. \n\nThe media says nothing.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

It saved increasing the transfer payments to the provinces.  The problem is it allowed other professions to jump on the band   wagon. It was wrong from the start.  If doctors need higher pay to convince them to stay in Canada, then pay them more.  Enough of these special tax brackets.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

The relationship (guanxi 关系） that was developed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau between Premier Li Keqiang was astounding in its complexity and efficacy.  Their families were able to enjoy each other's company. This is the way one should relate to the Chinese on all levels. Trudeau has been to China many times. Xiao Tudou - 小土豆 - Small Potato is a name that endears him to the Chinese. When people insult the prime minister by making fun of this lovely name, they insult the Chinese.  Why?

Yes, when voters are not satisfied with the way things have been going (especially on the jobs and taxes fronts) they tend to look for and support the change candidate.  \n\nAlthough traditional Canadian voter fatigue was the largest factor in the defeat of PM Harper in 2015,  desire for change fueled in part by the slowness (albeit the least slow of the G 7) of the recovery from the 2008 Great Recession was also a strong factor in the switch to Trudeau.\n\nThe Clown Prince's campaign slogan emphasized change as in: Hope and Hard Work.\n\nSubsequently, each member of the Trudeau cabinet has been doing the work of three men - Larry,. Curly and Moe.\n\nAnd the campaign slogan is morphing into Hopeless and No Work.  \n\nIt is always impossible for change candidates for president and PM to fully live up to voters`expectations.  Obama was not able to and already it is clear to most informed Canadians that Junior will not come close to doing so.\n\nLet us hope that Trump once again defies expectations.

Yet, legal system has various degrees when life is taken i.e. manslaughter; first degree murder; second degree manslaughter; premeditated; etc.  Law says - murder is wrong but the perp is judged by context, situation, motivation, etc.\n\nCatholics live in a both/and theology world - it is gray (not black and white).  Burke and company reject this *adult* approach to Catholic Anthropology, Morality, and Social Justice.  Faith is so much more than a black and white legal system as is the Church.

That is true, Alexandra, but only for some Trump voters.  It is irrational at best, but so is their entire interpretation of electoral politics.  What is part of the reality here is that Sec. Clinton was her own worst enemy in certain specific ways.  Her judgment in the case of the private email server, her incompetent response when it was revealed, her withholding of information about her bout of pneumonia, and her misguided addressing of the party elite rather then the folks of the working class (among other foolish mistakes) all added to the paranoid clatter of the rabid right wing GOP'ers.  None of it, of course, were criminal in nature or intent, but it all went to feeding the dragon with Trump as its ugly, fire-breathing head.

A significant amount of these so called Albertans were former Victoria residents who left for Alberta years ago to make their monies and are now simply repatriating it back home.

This is an old and tiresome canard.  There are 186 US dioceses.  With some exceptions, no diocese has enough candidates; much less actual ordinands to meet current needs.  So, a simplistic numerical comparison can give us your *comment*.  \nCARA has run numerous studies and the results clearly document that over seminary time, very conservative dioceses such as Lincoln do no better at ordination time than most other dioceses when looked at over a 5 or 10 year period average.\nLincoln attracts a higher number of seminarians but their actual ordination numbers aren't any better than other dioceses.\nWhat you also leave out in this cherry picked category is what happens later with Lincoln newly ordained priests in their first five years.  There is no mention of tensions, parish issues, etc.  \nWhat appeals in Lincoln would never succeed in most US dioceses and higher numbers don't mean that Lincoln is a better church.

Actually, in the reality I live in anyway, the President had a meeting with the gang of 12 congressional leaders in September and revealed to them that indeed it was Russia that had hacked into not just the DNC and Podesta but the election systems of several states as well as the RNC and several individual Congress people. McConnell told the President that if he revealed this information to the public he would accuse the POTUS of interfering in the election in favor of Clinton. Got that? A major security breech by Russia had happened to the point that the POTUS felt compelled to take the stunning information to the leaders of the Congress but the Senate Majority Leader threatened the POTUS rather than getting on board with an immediate all hands on deck investigation why a foreign country was interfering in our elections.

Siding with one set of clients over the other on the merits of the cases before them  is what judges are supposed to do in civil courts.\n\nThe problem in many, but perhaps not all, family courts, is that the judges tow the line on the 'pay the instigator' protocol that serves the lawyers, and ultimately only the lawyers.  Those family court judges use the power of the state to administer a private shake-down operation benefiting lawyers at the expense of broken families.  \n\nLike you, they say the clients are to blame, but their conduct is repeated and, with the benefit of the pay-the-instigator formula to provide guidance, predictable.  In these situations, one cannot go far wrong by following the money ... straight into the lawyers pockets.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021
It's so frustrating trying to reach people about this subject. I was threatened by legal action by a family member who told me to get a Zofran prescription instead of pot. In some states really great parents who test positive for pot can loose their kids. I read a horror story about a texas family loosing their son this way to a foster parent who murdered their son. I think women are afraid to admit using pot during their pregnancies so it's understudied. It's so common to smoke during pregnancy and I know at least 20 mothers off the top of my head who have and all those kids (grown to infants) are normal or exceptional. I really think that pot could actually improve brain function some how because I see so many kids/adults who's mom's smoked during pregnancy who are ahead of the pack with coordination and language. A lot of these pot smoking moms also tend to be more educated on nutrition and medicine. If only we could be more open and real studies and not propaganda were available.

While Communism seeks to marshal or harness the economic and political power of the nation-state by organizing through the idea of the worker. Carbonism although similarly structured, takes the organizing principle to the next level – first by substituting the nation-state for the world, and then by directly linking the combined economic and political power of each individual in the world, to the carbon footprint each creates in the world. And in the global context of Carbonism, this individual can either be a person, corporation or business.\n\nAs an aside, in many legal systems of this world, the corporation has the legal standing of an individual.

Rik... man, you really have a stick up your arse don't you? First off, the dams were ancient, and unless you wanted to spend millions more to repair them only to repair them again in another few years, it was best to take them down. Add in the increased cost of maintenance, and it would be prohibitive. \n\nSecond, the habitat gained by removal has, amazing as it might seem to you, been used by salmon, and used quite extensively. In fact, not only have they traveled deep into the park, but they have spawned, quite successfully in fact, throughout the river and tributaries opened up by dam removal. Salmon, as it turns out, are a very real source of income for thousands of fisherman across the state, and up in Alaska...  \n\nThird, the fix you suggest for US 101 is absurd, and a hell of a lot more expensive and potentially dangerous than building a new bridge. Maybe you don't realize how much rock would have to be moved, but it would be prohibitive and destabilizing to the hillside.	[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

FACT #8: FLUORIDE IS THE ONLY MEDICINE ADDED TO PUBLIC WATER\n\nFluoride is the only chemical added to water that doesn’t actually treat the water. Chlorine, for example, is added to kill bacteria so that we can drink the water without getting sick. Fluoride, by contrast, is added to prevent a disease (tooth decay) that is not caused by drinking water.\n\nFluoridation proponents claim that fluoridated water is not a medication because, in their view, it’s no different than adding iodine to salt or vitamin D to milk. What proponents fail to acknowledge, however, is that iodine and vitamin D are both essential nutrients; but fluoride is not.\n\nAn essential nutrient is something the body has a physiological demand for. If we don’t have enough iodine, for example, our thyroid gland won’t function properly. Although fluoride advocates sometimes claim that fluoride is a “nutrient,” the National Academy of Sciences has repeatedly confirmed that this is not the case.[40]	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021
"There already is ""cheating for all,"" and Western athletes exploit it for all its worth. It's called claiming to have ADHD, asthma, muscle pain, or any number of a wide range of health issues that are treated with dopaminergics. Dopamine is dopamine, regardless of whether the source is cocaine, methamphetamine, asthma medication, ADHD medication, chronic pain medication, or other source. Dopamine always improves physiological functionality, and body self-repairing and development. So, Western athletes just claim one of the numerous conditions that grants them a dopaminergic prescription, and presto: legalized professional doping.\n\nA Norwegian report for that 46 of Norway’s 61 Olympic champions since 1992 have using dopaminergic asthma medication, at doses 9 times higher than the 1600 mcg per day WADA claims to allow.

It's part of the job.\n\nRussia isn't accused of doing anything that Canada or the USA didn't also do, they're just accused of doing it while not claiming asthma or ADHD to legitimatize the action. The athletic enhancement benefits from taking dopaminergics is always the same, regardless of what its usage is claimed for. That's why this issue is clearly politically-driven - because the West is manipulating perception of semantics to isolate Russia.\n\nNorway has a proven documented higher doping rate than Russia is alleged to have by IOC officials, and yet there's no accusation towards Norway, because Norwegian athletes all claim asthma to be able to dope.

When he let Hillary off the hook over emails when that issue cut top the chase as to how dishonest and untrustworthy she was---he sealed his fate .  Sanders was a guy who accomplished little in his life and offered kids free college.  He didn't have the IQ to run a 7-11 successfully.  The leaks also showed us how the democrats shafted him .

The largest sized vessel that can dock in Vancouver is an Aframax, which can carry 500,000 to 700,000 barrels. Vessels at the port can only be loaded up to 80% due to depth and other restrictions, meaning a vessel can only be filled to around 550,000 barrels. That's a stark contrast to one million barrel Suezmaxes, or the two million very large carriers (VLCCs) commonly used to ship crude oil from Saudi Arabia, the Middle East and African countries to Asia and other countries around the world, including Canada (e.g. The Irving Oil refinery in N.B.). Most vessels that currently load in Vancouver go to refineries in Washington State, California or Hawaii. Traders said the price of Canadian crude shipped to Asia needs to be low enough to offset the cost of shipping across the Pacific on smaller vessels. They also note many Asian refiners prefer Iraqi crude due to lower acidity.\n(source: Canada oil sands Asia export dream faces port bottleneck, GulfNews.com)	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

John, I appreciate your reply...but I acknowledge a Dominican friend who always advised;  be aware of but one book.  There is so much more, and to my knowledge so much more than the cliche of the church founding science.  In fact many attest to the church and religion as a whole as obstructing the development of science.  Carl Sagan is one of them.  He said the ancient Greeks had all the knowledge necessary to them for the advancement of science.  If it were not for religion we would now have inter stellar travel.  If not for the Islam religion we would not have the preservation of ancient writings, and many scholars were only able to produce their work in the Arabic language.

The right to return is a show stopper since it effectively means the end of Israel as a safe haven for Jews from an Israeli point of view. It would effectively create two Palestinian states which is why the Palestinians insist on it.  Consider what happened to the Jews in other Arab countries. Where are they now? \n\nThe settlements would likely be given up if the Palestinians were serious about peace. Israel did this in Gaza and got the Hamas Charter as a reward. Besides, the Palestinians were committing acts of terror against Israel prior to 1967.\n\nArab-Israelis enjoy full rights including local Sharia law within Israel.  Ask any of them if they would prefer living in another Arab country or the West Bank. The Druze in the Golan Heights readily admit their life is much better in Israel than in Syria.\n\nBDS is viewed as simple antisemitism by the average Israeli and is having no real effect on Israel's economy.

That's true, but only when the economy is growing rapidly and there is a cash shortage. In that situation, Keynes recommended no government stimulus that would crowd out private ventures into markets. In conditions of stagnant growth and private cash hording, where we are today, Keynes recommended government direct job creation to inject money into the hands of consumers, whose buying would stimulate growth. \n\nTax cuts to corporations and people who are already swimming in cash won't create jobs or stimulate growth without demand for products from consumers. Without consumer demand, that cash won't be committed to economic growth. Therefore, tax cuts for the wealthy (and that's all the Republicans and Trump are interested in) won't move the meter on GDP. Paul Krugman has pointed out repeatedly that higher taxes have never reined in economic growth, and Keynes recommended demand side (consumer) stimulation with created jobs in times of slow growth.

Most of the continued problem is that the rapidly developing but poorer nations are emitting more GHG as fast as the already developed nations reduce their emissions.  I don't know of an easy solution here but it is why global emissions agreements include some kind of technology transfer and funding from already developed nations to help get poorer nations on to the desired track.

Abortion makes up 3% of the Planned Parenthood budget. So, either you are willfully ignorant or deliberately lying. Neither is a Christian thing to do. Your remark that abstinence (from sexual intercourse) has health benefits is nothing short of insane.\n\nHere's the breakdown on the Planned Parenthood budget:\nContraception - 35%\nSTD testing and treatment - 35%\nCancer screening and prevention - 16%\nOther women's health services - 10%\nAbortion services - 3%\nOther - 1% \n\nHaving seen the truth, you no longer have any excuse for spreading your malicious lies, no doubt inspired by Satan. At this point, if you believe in a just God, you need to fall on your knees, admit to your malicious lies, and ask His forgiveness. It also would be appropriate for you to apologize to all the gullible people whom you misled with your malicious lies. That may include your children.

The cost differential of the oilsands vs conventional sources is (and has been) disappearing quickly.\\n\nOne, the easy, ""gusher"" wells are becoming less productive, hence why we are looking to more non-conventional sources.  Two, new technologies in extraction are making it more efficient every year.  Last, along with materials and energy, labour is the other major cost in oilsands extraction.  Part of the reason it was so expensive were the absurd wages paid in Alberta during the boom - $100/hr for a truck driver, etc.\n\nThere are still people on this very board saying oilsands aren't profitable at $50, and they obviously know nothing.

You always forget that public institutions do not claim to be founded and directed by God.  The Catholic Church certainly does.  In a way, all of this legal wrangling is a direct result of the Catholic Church (among other churches) refusing to admit its sins and to do reasonable penance in aiding its own victims.  By reason of my own vocation, I stand in shame about that.  And by such professed and strict adherence to the Church without exception, Marty E, you, too, should stand in shame as well.

Check out Dr. Robert Epstein's work. In exploring sexual orientation, he surveyed a large sample of men & women & found that sexual orientation was on the same sort of continuum we see for many measures. He found that very few people were strictly hetrosexual or strictly homosexual, but fell somewhere 0% to 100% either or. Where people fell on that spectrum impacted what types of relationships they were comfortable with. Someone 80% heterosexual could be happy going their entire life in only straight relationships, while someone 30% heterosexual - i.e. 70% homosexual, might have sex with the opposite sex but would probably be more comfortable in a homosexual relationship. It depends on degree & other factors, including one's family & society's attitudes. \n\nOn the other hand, when he measured gender characteristics he found that most adults are right in the middle with a mix of both feminine & masculine traits. Hyper-either gender was rare - but those outliers might explain dysphoria.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

I think your post is a great example of why the democrats lost. Obama was in office for 8 years, but by many margins, he was a failed President. He did some things right, but many wrong. Along comes Hillary for the second time running for the Presidency (I think that was a mistake) and you all thought she had it in the bag, most of the left-wing press also had already crowned her President before the votes were counted. She campaigned in $1000 dollar pantsuits, dragging out rich celebrities to speak on her behalf to blue collar workers. She dragged along her husband Bill, who got a free pass on his sexual harassing past by Democratic women and Hillary, while she spoke to the crowds about the importance of women's rights and equality without a hint of hypocrisy.\nThey weren't buying it, so if you want to blame someone for Trump's election to President, you should blame the democrats who put him there.

Do you know someone suffering from Putrumpski Undeniabley Stupid Syndrome & YUGE Simpletons disorder (PUSSYS)? PUSSYS is a pattern of pathologically dissociative & psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of November 8th 2016, & increasing in severity with passing time. Sufferers of PUSSYS often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, the delusion that they are the majority, sudden & prolonged bouts of self-pity coupled w/inexplicable feelings of euphoria followed by uncontrollable whining. PUSSYS is characterized by a persistent unwillingness to see that Trump is a pathological liar put in office by Putin & is an illegitimate president. In moments of lucidity, they experience intense fear that Trump will be impeached. Research is ongoing, but PUSSYS appears to correlate closely w/some of the following factors: Conservatism, profound ignorance; excessive religiosity, NRA membership, living in isolated rural areas. PUSSYS is known to rapidly reproduce in red states.	[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

Not a false choice at all. None of us were required to buy health insurance until recently, but we could buy it if we wanted it. None of us had to wear seat belts or a motorcycle helmet back in the day, but we could if we wanted to. Just because the seat belt maker is happy does that make 330 million of the rest of us happy. If you forget to buckle up and get a ticket are you happy? I prefer a four point harness, my friend prefers no seatbelt at all. It's her life, let her do what she wants.

An open and free marketplace is not logical, especially without strict regulation that would, in essence, make it the ACA. An open and free marketplace may be great for those individuals who can afford better coverage at higher rates. What this creates, however, are companies offering DISCOUNT DISCOUNT DISCOUNT plans yet terrible coverage and service. They are simply going to take advantage of the open marketplace to trick those who cannot afford better coverage into bad service and bad coverage. The ACA currently mitigates this by placing regulations on what companies can and can't do. You also ignore the millions of people with access to better healthcare under the ACA, thus allowing them to receive the care they need, thus mitigating some of the workforce loss due to ailments.

I like your 'handle' of looking for solutions.  I wish everyone who made a complaint would also have to suggest a solution.  It is too easy to tear things down with no real alternatives put forward.  I do agree that money is not the only way to improve schools - but it is also not the wrong way.  More funding is just about the only way to make class sizes smaller.  (And anyone who says class sizes don't matter should try to substitute teach in an elementary classroom with 33 3rd graders and one teacher - not the home school dream scenario).  Local school districts, run by local school boards, determine how to spend the money from the state.  Every district has a budget committee that the public at large can serve on, to get a better understanding of and make decisions about school budgets.  I would encourage you to join a public school budget committee.  Or at least talk to a budget committee member to get their perspective about what real fiscal challenges school districts face.

I agree. Better to leave these people to the despots and thugs who know how to keep them in line. They are obviously to ignorant to embrace freedom and are better off subjugated. Thank god for the efforts of Cuba, North Korea and East Germany to contain their own. No US/NATO  forces interfering and everyone kept at home. The middle east would have been so peaceful now if Saddam had been allowed to take care of those uppity Kuwaitis as well as his own countryman. Now, if Iran and other Muslim countries could keep their people from running off to North America and Europe, we'd even have less chance of being 'overwhelmed'.\nI think you've got it Richard...just leave well enough alone. Let sleeping dogs lay and encourage the existing containment of the masses. The sooner this happens, the less likely those people are apt to fall into lawless chaos.

Testing is only a part of the process. Even high school in the U.S. require testing for children to see what their interests are. Germany spends the entire year introducing children to job opportunities. They sit down with their teachers and PARENTS to find out the direction they should go. Going to college is extremely competitive because there are so few slots to fill. German students took their careers very serious. In my opinion they were much more mature than American children.

Both my statements above are proved by our discussions here, in the past few days and weeks.\nFor example, on my 'press citation' point:- You claimed that the 'US non-Catholic media' only wrote about Cardinal Burke, and you stated that none of that media had bothered even to mention the '13 Cardinals letter' (prior to the 2nd synod) because Burke wasn't one of the 13 signatories. It then took me about 5 minutes online searching, to turn up the fact that that the New Yorker had mentioned the 13 Cardinals letter. I stopped looking at that point, having proved you wrong. I gave you my findings, and/but you then came back with a comment along the lines that one press source wasn't enough. Well, yes it was. \nAnd so on.\nI am well able to prove what I write.\nBTW, I have not made an 'ad hominem' attack on you.

I have never had a need to put together a complete CV and there is not nearly enough room in the limited space allowed here. But I will tell you I have been at this for nearly 50 years with my wildlife research starting when I was in high school. I used to go to the UC Berkeley campus to look over scientific publications in the Life Sciences Library.  My first big accomplishment was in my 20's. I helped set up a successful Peregrine Falcon captive breeding facility in CA.  They were endangered at the time with only 5 nest sites known in CA.  Getting the breeding stock for this project took years of dedicated work. Many of the falcons released into the wild by UC Santa Cruz came from my falcons.  Anyone can find my articles on the internet. Just look up my name with the words eagles, turbines or wind energy.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021
No I certainly don't roll over and die. I do however right now have plans in place for if that day happens. I have worked very hard and amassed extra food, water, guns, ammo, precious metals etc. I have found areas geographically which I have found to be safe with an abundance of life to support myself and my family. I was always taught that a little planning goes a long way so I'm not worried in the slightest of that situation forcing me to break another countries laws. Once again how are we so wealthy. I've seen poverty rates in every demographic exploding with our own legal citizens. Households struggling to pay off debts. Every single facet of life only increases in price.

Critical speech against Islam is fine, I think the vast majority of Canadian Muslims are fine with ignoring it. We have ignored it for decades to be honest. However, critical speech is not what we are facing these days and it is not what we are protesting against.\n\nIn the 2016 Environics study of the Muslim community, Muslim youth was the LEAST optimistic about their future in Canada, and Muslim elders were the MOST optimistic. That should tell you the direction this country is headed if these simple motions are met with spin and politicking. Looking at this as a secular should not bring you to a different opinion. If anything is in danger of suppressing free speech, it can be brought to the Supreme Court. We have a Constitution for a reason.

They Christianized the Indians and mixed with them, and in the 1800's those mixed raced folks fought for their independence from Spain and formed Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Panama, Brazil, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Uruguay, Ecuador, and Venezuela. There are roughly 583 million indian/mixed Indian people in the americas, in comparison to a white (non-Latino) population of 190 million. The white population has been on a swift decline of over 10% per decade, leading me to believe that non-Latino whites will become a minority and mixed race indians will become the majority in the US by 2030. The term Latino does not accurately depict race, it's a term that depicts ethnicity of mostly mixed race indians from south of the US border.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

Good evening, my friend Keaukaha>  It is a rainy and stormy night, but I do feel that the POTUS did put some kala in his pocket with the speech that he presented to the Congress this very evening.  I would think that a speech of this magnitude would have required him to rehearse somewhat before the presentation.  Besides  that, the meat of the speech was worthy of some praise, as it reinforces what he had promised the people and proves that he is keeping his word to them.  The actions that will follow his words should be noteworthy and comforting to the people.  The matter of whether the DEMs will put aside their hate for him and work to attain those objectives will be a factor in what the results will be in the 2018 elections.  I wasn't born with a silver spoon either, and through hard work and sweat, I managed to eke out a decent living and retirement for myself.

Here's how much the average American family has saved for retirement\nwww.cnbc.com/.../heres-how-much-the-average-american-family-has-saved-for-retire...\nSep 12, 2016 - Whereas the average savings of a family with members between 32 and 37 is $31,644, the median savings is less than $500. At the other end, the average savings of families close to retirement — ages 56 to 61 — is $163,557. The median is $17,000.\n\nGo to www.cnbc.com and read the study for yourself.  As you can see by the headline numbers above, the wealth disparity revealed by the gap between the median and average figures is staggering.  Winnipeg Warrior should also take note, the macro figures he relies on to undercut the argument made in the article do not give a sufficiently granular picture of how the U.S. economy appears from the ground.

Seanog, I guess it's really hard to believe that Roman Rite Catholicism does not credit women as worthy of any serious attention...unless those women are fawning over or agreeing with the reigning hierarch, that is.  It's a Roman Rite theological/doctrinal thing, God being male and all that.  \n\nIt seems so strange that so many Catholics believe that this will someday change.  Do reform Catholics really think that Roman theology/doctrine will be changed to reflect the equality of genders...when even Pope Francis refuses to consider any kind of doctrinal change?  Of course, pastoral change is easier as it flows with the pope in power, but pastoral change doesn't last like doctrine does. \n\n We need a Vatican II Rite Church in union with Rome, whether Rome likes it or not.  And Rome needs that Rite/Church if ever Catholicism is to regain any credibility.  Google Rite Beyond Rome.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

"""Hike teacher pay"" means actually pay teachers to keep up with cost of living after an 8 year salary freeze, doubling insurance rates, and higher cost of living.  There has been a *minor* raise but it is nothing to make up for the last few years.  Newer teachers in Washington state are among some of the lowest paid in the country.  \n\nSalary is not competitive, is not at all comparable to similar fields with parallel prerequisites, and does not cover the qualifications needed to have this job.

It represents a tiny minority of Muslims in the Middle East, let alone world wide, but they are grossly over represented in terrorist groups and activities.

Albert74 & oldgit\n\nThe minimum withdrawals from a RRIF start at age 55 if you have set up a RRIF that young. \n\nhttp://www.taxtips.ca/rrsp/rrif-minimum-withdrawal-factors.htm\n\nI also want to mention to Albert that there is a 'pension' credit of $2000 annually from pension income that kicks in at age 55. So if you are trying to wind down a RRSP in the most tax efficient manner it can make sense to create a RRIF at retirement that is large enough to allow you to withdraw this amount and take advantage of the credit until you are forced to create a RRIF with any remaining RRSP money at age 71. \n\nI will also point out that when setting up a RRIF (it HAS to be done when creating the RRIF) that you can use the younger spouse's age to calculate the minimum withdrawals. Example, I am younger than my wife so when setting up her RRIF we will use MY age to determine minimum RRIF withdrawal rates.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

Canada has no effective, comprehensive training programs for the exam.  There is no real curriculum.  There is little evidence as to the historical development of the exam or its competencies with little validation effort on an annual basis (or ever). Information regarding exam development and validation in other countries is available and readily accessible. However, in Canada, attempts to access similar information has resulted in being told that such information does not exist or that it is ‘confidential’.  An open, accountable and transparent licensing process should not be operated in such fashion. The current Canadian regulatory model appears to be one of the most stringent, if not the most stringent, in the world and the pass rate for the current Canadian examination is by far the lowest amongst comparable jurisdictions. What justifies this level of Canadian exceptionalism? The onus lies on those who regulate, and those who propose to self-regulate, to respond to this question.

Government control and expansion of health education would ensure that enough trained providers are available.  Compensation would be pegged to comparable good jobs achieved by folks with comparable education like engineers and lawyers (for MD's) and other trades for other health care positions.  Insurance would be entirely eliminated.  All citizens would be covered.  I would be targeting a factor of 2 or more total per capita cost reduction in the medical industry via eliminating insurance cut and reduced (high end) industry wages.

"""You ever see Dairy farmers? They are loaded to the gills, driving Cadillac escalades""\n\nTo your first question: of course, they are my in-laws. Also, many neighbours & friends.\nTo your second point: Pardon? I have never, ever known a local farmer (dairy or otherwise) who drove a Cadillac and was obviously wealthy. The ones I know are very hard-working and careful with their pennies because they have to be.\n\nUninformed generalizations like yours are hurtful in more ways than one. Supply management is not perfect but it has provided financial security to farmers for many years. It ensures quality products (no BGH) and steady supply at an affordable price. Ask any of the old-timers what it was like to sell milk prior to 1970. Our supply managed sectors anchor our local farm economies, farm suppliers and rural communities. They, in turn,  maintain what remains of our prime farmland. \n\nIt sounds as if you would happily sacrifice all of that to save a few pennies on your milk & cheese."

Roy Kamisato, The gist of Brewbaker's article is that economics, and not public health, should be the primary factor in evaluating the use of pesticides.  From his point of view the pesticides are used on crops that make lots of money for Hawaii's economy, and public health consequences are secondary.  However, even his economic analysis is flawed because it does not take into consideration the illness and disease resulting from the pesticide use and the associated costs of medical care.

"BD\n\nCan't agree with your referral to ""bygone eras"".  Yes, the large landowners USED to be synonymous with Agribusiness, specifically Sugar & Pine.  It's not like that anymore, the operators are generally Lessee's and the current land owners are just collecting rent.  You can't expect to extract lateral concessions from the landowner based on what their lessee's are requesting or lobbying for at the Lege.  \nIn regards to A&B's defense of their historic water rights, I would think this has more to do with the present and future value of the water than necessarily it's current use (or lack thereof).  In no small part the support for A&B's continued allocation is that once the water goes back into the watersheds there is little chance the water will ever be reallocated.  As well, the watersheds have adapted over the long term of the diversions.\n\n I'll say that as sloppy as Angus is in certain areas he is a valuable resource at the Lege, perhaps more smart than wise.

Hassleberger \nI do think he did the right thing by resigning,  but big deal,  you should do the right thing.  It was good that he told the archbishop that he should resign.\n \nPR2, as usual, makes a good point.  That archdiocese put the faithful through a mess, to put it mildly.

Sweden is culturally very different from North America.   I was reading something written by a Swede recently (don't recall where) that talked about how the fact that Sweden was considered a poor country until not too long ago -- less than 100 years -- and Swedes have a strong ethos around supporting one another because that's how they survived for a long time.\n\nThe fundamental ethos of the United States is utterly different.   One of the strongest ideas is that anyone could go from rags to riches and they could do it through their own hard work and ingenuity.   Individualism is paramount, even if social mobility has declined, which is has over the past few decades.\n\nCanada is different yet again, however, we're not as community-minded as either the Swedes or the Japanese.   A lot of Canadians identify with being community-aware, but individualism is also strong here compared to a lot of places.   All one has to do is read a lot of the comments on these boards to know that's the case.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

I think the mistake Bishop Tobin makes is to confuse the vehicle with the passenger. We are called to believe in God through the gospel of Jesus. The Church is simply the vehicle by which God and gospel come down to us. When that vehicle functions as it should, it brings God and gospel to the people. When it malfunctions, it sets up shop and invites the people to come to it, largely on its own terms, which is what I read Bishop Tobin's comments to imply: young people should remain in the Church because the Church has the sacraments. The sacraments, by definition, are not grace, but vehicles of grace and, as such, they are meant to bring God to the people. Once again, the Bishop assumes the sacraments are the possession of the Church and the people should come to it, whether the Church speaks their language or not, whether the Church is a flawed vehicle and countersign of faith or not. As a result, he sees tens of millions of Catholics leaving the Church and thinks he's just fine.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

I think that things started changing as technology got better or actually worse. When there became many multiple channels that had to be filled 24/7 with anything than anyone could put out there and try to make people react to actually hurt the news media and especially when big money could use the news to their advantage. When anybody with an Ipod or computer can sit in his living room and incite thousands of people that have too much time on their hands and no knowledge of a subject then there goes the honest news. When there was just radio and a couple of TV channels and a non partial newspaper then news was news. I remember when Oregon had the Oregon Journal and the Oregonian and the Journal closed it's doors and the Oregonian was left leaning consequently like ADN, Oregon started sliding to the left and it's been that way every since. Honest news, researched news to be sure is very valuable but with all of the garbage out there the sources are hard to verify anymore.	[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

"Could king's man elaborate on ""linguistic discrimination"" of "" millions of Ukrainians""?\nMost Russians have some Ukrainian blood, and vice versa. It is  hard to distinguish between the two. People in USSR moved around quite a bit. Most people who identify themselves as Ukrainian speak Russian as their primary language, the only exception being the Western Ukraine and  rural areas. \nThis may be hard to comprehend for members of Canadian Ukrainian diaspora.\n In fact, it was the Soviet leadership who actively promoted Ukrainian language and culture. To suggest that anyone of Ukrainian origin living in Russia is subject to linguistic discrimination is beyond ridiculous. The opposite (discrimination of Russian speakers and forced Ukrainization) is a well-documented fact. The whole independent Ukraine project had one goal - to create  ""Anti-Russia"", and Ukrainization was an integral part of it. \n\nYour claim that ""Putin much admires"" Hitler is as ridiculous as the ""linguistic discrimination""."

Sure. But that is just an alternate way of accomplishing Rob Carrick's advice, since you then effectively make one more monthly payment per year. Here are three ways to do pay off principal faster (maybe there are more):\n\n- occasional lump payments (what Rob was discussing)\n- paying the same amount more frequently (accelerated payments)\n- paying a larger amount with the same frequency (a different variant of accelerated)\n\nFor sure any of those will have an effect. If that was everyone's point, then fair enough.\n\nNonetheless there does seem to be confusion on this score. If you commit to spend a certain fraction of your income (equivalently, a certain number of dollars per year) on your mortgage, whether you pay that amount on a weekly, biweekly, twice a month, or monthly basis doesn't really matter much. At that point it is more a matter of what works best given your income cash flow.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

The Cons have thrown dirt at Hillary for years, most of it based on false and/or misleading claims. Unfortunately, the smears Cons cooked up and promoted so vigorously have a tendency to stick, even when the truth is readily available.\n\nNone of the Clintons receive compensation for their work at the Foundation. Some of Hillary's actions have less than great optic politically, but there is no actual proof that she did anything wrong or illegal or unethical. Indeed, in terms of current politicians, she's pretty damn clean and honest and has worked on behalf of the working class and middleclass.

I concur, in particular, with your observation that the 'Story of Some of Us' skips over 600 years or more of vital, formative Canadian history. \n\nNova Scotia and New Brunswick have understandably taken umbrage with the notion that Canada began in 1608 at Quebec. Newfoundland and Labrador has yet to express its indignation - reflecting perhaps its 68 year resignation with repeated attempts to minimize its historical relevance to the evolution of Canada. That's what happens when you're late signing up. Still, Sir Humphrey might be miffed that his 1583 expedition to the then well established fishing station at St. John's to claim the region for the English cost him not only his life but his place in history.\n\nStaking one's claim to first is a mug's game - not only because it keeps getting uprooted by archeologists but because it gets in the way of telling the story in the way that is more important to the audience and less important to the people who pay to have it written.

Thank you Democrats for pushing this over the edge. No reason for Trump to even try and nominate someone from closer to the middle of the road.

The marines stopped at the Yalu, and at that point MacArthur had defeated the North Korean army. But the Chinese Liberation Army, far more numerous than the UN forces, launched a somewhat sneak attack on the UN forces, and the marines had to walk back in the middle of winter. MacArthur then wanted to drop nukes on China, but Truman wouldn't let him, as this would have led to a wider war with unpredictable consequences, but likely dragging in the USSR, which supplied arms to the Chinese and the North Koreans. Most notably T-34 tanks and MIG fighters with swept-back wings, which the USAF didn't have until later in the war. Some of the MIGs were flown by Russian pilots. Subsequently the UN forces were forced to retreat and North Korea was reestablished as a communist state, with Chinese support. So, the US was not in a position to cross into China, short of nuclear war. \nThe stalemate continues and isn't going to end anytime soon, while the Chinese military gets stronger by the day.

The originalist position isn't that situations remain unchanged, but that the language of the law when written expresses an intent that a) is knowable; and b) unless violating other constraints of the Constitution, remains in effect until said law is changed/modified/repealed (a power given exclusively to the Legislature, though in some cases they have delegated authority to the Executive branch). \nThe originalist's critique is that you don't want un-elected, life-tenured judges making new law. Anytime I hear a liberal friend make the case that they want a 'living' Constitution (as advocated by Posner in the 7th Circuit), I ask them whether they would want that latitude extended to a majority conservative court. Such a court is a distinct possibility now (forget Gorsuch, talking about Kennedy or RBG replaced). \nWhen the shoe's on the other foot, the danger of 'legislating from the bench' comes into focus. Originalism is a method that constrains the court regardless of its leanings.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

"Thanks for the info @Janey7.  I camp all over this Province, and use the dayuse areas, and have not encountered pay parking in the past few years other than for the odd overnight situation. I was under the impression that in 2010 all fees were eliminated.\n\nI know Cultus Lake  operates under a different format and has paid parking - maybe something to do with the proximity of parking to the residential area.

"Re: Citizen's United - ""corporations as people"" is Supreme Court doctrine going back to at least 1886 in the Southern Pacific case. Justice Waite said back then, of whether the 14th amendment extended equal protection under the law to corporations, not just natural persons: ""We are all of the opinion that it does"".\nSo no, CU wasn't activism, rather it enforced a long-established precedent with the message that if the country wants that to change, it needs to go through the appropriate legislative process to do so (which still hasn't happened, BTW). \nAn opposite ruling on CU would have cast over a hundred years' worth of seemingly unrelated settled law into question because the core principle of 14A coverage would have been fundamentally altered. Does the NYT corporation not have freedom of speech? Does your private company not enjoy freedom from unreasonable search and seizure?

I've spoken with both my High-School age daughters:  If they choose to try or use alcohol or cannabis only do so in moderation, only among trusted friends, and definitely don't succumb to peer-pressure from any idiot seeking to get them wasted.  \n\nFor under 18, cannabis and alcohol are both illegal.  Personally, I think my daughters would be smarter to try a puff of cannabis over getting drunk.  Cannabis is safer choice over alcohol.  \n\nOf course it's best if they don't do either, but that's just head in the sand thinking.   It's not going to happen.  Teens want and need to experiment a bit, and inevitably they're going to give weed and alcohol a try.  \n\nHaving great role-models, keeping lines of communication open with the likes of yours truly, having great and attainable goals in their lives, and witnessing a family lifestyle of moderation is the key to successfully navigating their way through teenage wasteland.\n\nSo far, so good.

"You are not alone in being unable to question the premise that indissolubility is a rule made by Jesus.  I read an article in First Things earlier today in which the author tried to set out different and opposing views on chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia, but he held to the same premise in describing both views.\n\nIt is a serious problem for the church.  Rules are about drawing lines.  Jesus was about something else.  St. Augustine put it concisely: ""love God and do what you will.""  The value of the pastoral focus of Pope Francis -- and he is not touching the rules -- is that it gets in touch with the real lives of people and turns the church toward a different way of teaching.  Instead of teaching rules, teach getting in touch with the God who loves us.  \n\nIf indissolubility is taken as a rule rather than an exhortation, there are too many palpable injustices in the real lives of real people.  That's the way rules are, which is why ascribing this as a rule of Jesus is idolatry."	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

The Bishops are frankly human beings, though Ordained under the significant establishment through the order of the Priesthood. A Sacramental gift. But, their error in humanity (hence, sin. The inclination to do wrong. Everyone is prone to do doing wrong at more or less a degree/level.) That is quite what people have forgotten. The Church began to teach real rights and wrongs (moral authority of truth.) And then the pandemic sexual revolution started to play up within Her own walls. That cultural phenomenon did historically occur when in parallel a vast majority of the cases of child sex abuse by priests occurred. Under the clout of the sexual revolution did sexual predators within the Church, Her walls, and the cloak of a priest use that as a cover. Wherefore, these predatory men find vulnerable children to seek/vex/gratify themselves upon (like wolves.) Thus, to pretend the sexual revolution was an isolated occurrence, would be inaccurate and faulty.	[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

No, it is very clearly proven that the BCLiberal policies of lower taxes for small business are primarily responsible for digging us out of the hole left by the incompetent NDP.  Since 2001, BC has seen our unemploymenet fall from 10% to 6%, despite the entire rest of Canada being in the doldrums or downright recession.  Look at Alberta, Ontario, the maritimes and Quebec!  Ontario especially has even more exploding real estate than BC and yet it remains in a tailspin.  If the NDP gets in and jacks up small business taxes spending heavily on social programs we will see a return to high unemployment in BC.  Also, since the BCL took power in BC, small business ownershi rate soared t the highest in all of Canada at 19% (by 2010, it is even higher now).

Good point.  But not all current Metis can claim to be half European and half aboriginal.  The first Metis were born in the mid-18th century, typically to a European father and an aboriginal mother.   That is about 10 generations ago.  How many of the current Metis would be able to trace all sides of their family trees back 10 generations to show that every one of those ancestors was a pure Metis? What if 75% of their ancestors were European - are they still Metis? Race-based policies and benefits inevitably lead to these questions, which should be anathema to any modern democratic state where all are supposedly equal.

Oh Pizza Boy, ignorance is so bliss.

The evolution of humankind from small hunter and gatherer tribes to states based on agriculture, with the accompanying urbanisation, social stratification, exploitation, empire-building, and development of advanced civilisations, is also one of the fascinating watershed events of history that still affects us, and that happened in many different parts of the world. \n\nBut then the more recent watershed event that has influenced pretty much the whole world is the development of modern science and technology, which led to industrialisation, and that only happened in a very specific part of the world, northwestern Europe. That led to the social developments of modern democracies. And those are developments that impacted the rest of the world in profound ways, too, including culturally.

With all respect, there is more to it than that. Neither Hillary or Trump are stewards of morality, and as I see it, Hillary is quite worse. I believe that Catholics who voted for Trump voted for him because they saw him as the lesser of two evils. As I see it, the Democratic party is moving more and more to the left at a dangerous speed; we see that a large bloc of the party advocates for socialists policies. Hillary become the emblem of all those beliefs. She touted--as all democrats do--more big government programs, which stifle the liberty of our nation. The left has completely gone crazy, they exacerbate race tensions, have an strong distaste for capitalism, and they are so hung on identity politics. All their policies merge into a regressive doctrine, not a progressive one--as many of them like to believe, so it makes sense that many Catholics chose to vote Trump, conservative and or libertarian values seem like the better alternative to creating real progress.

I worked on the slope for about twenty years and was laid off last year. The vast majority of the crew I worked with were from out of state. They often mentioned that the only money they spent in Alaska was a drink or two at the airport while waiting for their flight home. A income tax would give these folks some incentive to work in there own state. If half of them would do so and Alaskans filled their spots, what would the economic impact be on Alaska? Quite positive I believe...\nI say institute a fairly high income tax. Combine this with a substantial tax deduction if you have received a PFD distribution. This would give Alaskans a moderate income tax and give the out of staters even more incentive to  either move here and become productive residents or seek work elsewhere.

You are right about opposites. The conventional view (like the stock market and pundits) is that tax cuts equal growth in job and GDP, but in actuality the opposite has happened. You just need to look at the history of tax cuts which started with Bush just after Clinton increased taxes and got the highest job growth in history, reduced the deficit, and after the those cuts continued and extended by Obama, we have never gotten the economic growth that Clinton got. One of Reagan's former economic advisers and a conservative wrote a famous book about this and the damage that Bush's tax cuts did because they did not match the environment in which Reagan's cuts were made. Today he advises strongly against tax cuts and he and some other advisers like David Stockman advise tax increases on the rich who have benefitted immensely from years of tax cuts without adding to economic growth and investment.

Dear RockChalkWombat,\n\nWe must not be subordinate to the decision of the woman at the heart of the abortion matter.  We have to be submissive to God's Will and not man's will (desires).   At the end of the day, we go to bed, close our eyes and with the help of our Lord God and not the help of man, we are grateful to wake up and face the next day.   At the end of our temporary lives here on earth, we have to face God and not man.  It is God's mercy we seek when we leave this world and not man's.  Remember the devil refused to be submissive to God.  For this he lost eternal life.  Let us seek that what is good and pleases our Father in Heaven and not that what pleases mankind, especially when mankind, like the devil refuses to serve God but chooses rather to serve his own desires.  Don't forget why Jesus was born and why He died.  To save us from our sins and free us from the chains that keep us imprisoned to our sinful natures.

That is the whole reason why they exist and if they aren't making money then they will close up shop, putting people out of work and hurting pension plans and personal savings, not to mention government revenues.\n\nCorporations SHOULD make money and there is absolutely nothing wrong with them making more money (and, likewise, there is absolutely nothing wrong with you choosing not to purchase the goods or services they offer if you feel they are charging too much).  Government's job is simply to ensure that these corporations have an equal and level playing field so that competition can exist, and THAT is where Ms. Layton's comments fall flat on their face.

The calculator asks for an average expected rate of return, NOT an interest rate.  Interest rates for things like GICs and aaa bonds will likely track inflation anyways.  Thus, any gain in future value is likely 0% gain in real dollars, regardless of the interest rate.  GICs are giving only a net loss or gain of 0% these days, like always.    I would imagine most TFSA do not have much interest-bearing securities in them, unless the investor finds that avoiding tax on GICs makes sense for him, as they are taxed at a higher rate than capital gains on growth securities like stocks/funds, and they keep those in other holdings like RRSP or non-registered accounts.

Makiki123, I regret to tell you that you are wrong.  The KKK was started by a group of Confederate veterans who happened to be Democrats.   The KKK engaged in terrorist raids against blacks and white Republicans at night, employing intimidation, destruction of property, assault, and murder to achieve its aims and influence upcoming elections. In a few Southern states, Republicans organized militia units to break up the Klan.  Its first Grand Wizard was former Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Democrat, who in 1868 was a pledged delegate from Tennessee to the New York Democratic National Convention.

Klastri, the VA health care system was established to care for veterans with service connected diseases or injuries and operated like that until 1979.  That is when the Carter Administration and the Democrat-controlled congress determined VA was capable of providing healthcare to all veterans who served on active duty in a military service and were separated under any condition other than dishonorable.  The source of their diseases or injuries no longer had to be related to their military service.  That made millions of veterans eligible for VA health care which is the main reason why VA has been pushed beyond the breaking point.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

agree with you on some points. i disagree that the reason for having d2 sports is to prevent hurting anyone's feelings. participation in high school extra curricular activities (in this case sports) plays a big part  in developing a young person. to have league games that are competitive (and safe in some sport's cases) a tiered system helps. agree that the contest might not be the same quality as with d1 teams, but many are still competitive and probably more so because of the levelness of the playing field.  the values and teaching opportunities are still there during the pre season commitment, practices, and games. i think where this goes sideways is with hhsaa. i agree that there does not need to be a state championship for all levels of competition (just d1). i think it's just a money making opportunity for the hhsaa. put it another way, if there were no d2 state championships, would teams still have their regular seasons and championships?

You have it exactly backwards. All Hawaii residents do NOT pay for the project. Only people who make purchases on Oahu pay for it and have been since January 2007. However, all Hawaii residents benefit from the 10% skim the legislature takes from the surcharge that goes into the state general fund. The surcharge is bailing out the state. These general fund revenues are used to pay for projects, services and programs all over the state. \nNow, the House leadership wants to settle political scores with Caldwell from his time there as majority leader, and they are doing it by not allowing the GET surcharge to continue past the current limit. Stopping the GET surcharge forces him to do things that are politically unpopular (raise property taxes and fees and cut services). Ouch! The skin in the game is Caldwell's political skin. House leaders don't care that punishing their former enemy at the legislature is inflicting pain on all the residents of Oahu.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

Kira, for many of us, one of the problems with the Superintendent who will be leaving soon was not that she was local. There are plenty of good local educators and administrators. The thing that made life exceedingly difficult was that she had no professional knowledge of Education, had no shared experience of teaching children, did not understand how schools work, surrounded herself with other executives who were not familiar with education issues, and insulated herself from schools and her employees. In essence, she was a political appointee and was placed in the position for the same reasons she was placed previously as the head of the Board of Water Supply. Having said that, I personally would like to see some new DNA in the system. I would however, rather see a first-rate local Superintendent than a third-rate Mainland one.

Actually Dowd made her article more about the Republican health care act and its shortcomings, and secondarily about Trump and Ryan. Her point is that representatives will face increased opposition at home if the health care act is passed as it stands by the Senate. I doubt that will happen. \n\nYou're right that Dowd has expanded on the Trump personality, but really, like all other bills, personality plays a big part, along with political ideology. You can't have a discussion on a major law without considering the personalities and ideologies of those involved. If Congress were to rationally follow cost-cutting measures, Congress could do it within the ACA model. Or, they could switch to single-payer, but ideology stands in the way (that's back to personality). As a nation we could afford the ACA, though it's gone. If the AHCA as it stands is passed, it will be a giant step backward, a lot of people will lose a lot, and a lot of people will be plenty angry. That's what Dowd is saying.

Even though I was born and raised a Catholic I find it easier for me to preform these tasks without supporting some slimy bishop living in a mansion. I have even preformed these tasks while dealing with cancer. I have also had a slimy bishop suggest that I lie to my family and not tell them about abuse that happend to me.

"When I look at the 40+ translations on Biblegateway for Matthew 6:7 -- praying like Pagans, it would seem many prefer 'babbling' or 'repeating' or both. I thought the verse meant that the Pagans were trying to control the god by reciting various formulas or incantations (I don't recall where I learned that). So Jesus meant that controlling the god is not the purpose of prayer. The next verse is 'Your Abba knows what you need even before you ask,' so no need to ask. Then the text has the Our Father which is not necessarily a prayer of petition. How could it be if Jesus has just said no need to ask. Rather think of exclamations.  ""!!! You give us each day our daily bread !!!"" Not a petition. Not trying to control the god. For the historical Jesus, the Mass would resemble Pagan babble \n\nAs for Fatima, it came out of the minds of those children.

Let's imagine we are jurors with only the evidence in this story as we discuss our verdict.\n\nYou say there is no evidence here. But that is not correct. We have the testimony of the two people present at that meeting on the bishop's patio, and their stories are contradictory. Juries have this dilemma of choosing who is more credible all time time, most obviously in alleged rape trials.\n\nI say the deacon's story is most plausible because he admits signing a document admitting he had previously lied! A liar does not do that. He could have said he refused to sign. By admitting the bishop has a document, the deacon opens himself to the bishop destroying the document and saying it never existed. If inventing a lie, the deacon would not have placed himself into that situation; its just silly unless it is true.\n\nThere are no known reasons for the deacon to lie, but the bishop has good reason to lie.\n\nThis is not a smoking gun, but it is real evidence of the sort juries have to deal with.

It's a complex problem. The patient may no longer be acute, but still require 24/7 care or aren't stable enough to come home, among other reasons. This can also pose a risk of re-admit if they are taken home too early. This is especially true for complex chronic illnesses where the patient has multiple comorbidities. \n\nIf they're going home and the care level is too high, the caregiver risks burnout, the patient risks a readmit, and their caregiver is likely not a doctor who is able to respond any other way but going back to the hospital.\n\nRetirement homes often don't have RNs or those trained enough to handle a patient with complex chronic illness. They are often staffed with one RPN and care is mainly provided by PSWs. \n\nLong term care has wait lists and many issues.\n\nThe family doctor is merely a coordinator to specialists.

It's a function of risk and reward, which in turn drives cost.  If airlines response to the new regulation is to reduce or eliminate overbooking, then they bear the risk of lower revenue (due to no-shows).  Currently, they overbook and transfer some risk to passengers that they may get bumped.  If there is a risk of lower revenue, airlines may increase fares as a risk premium, as they are ultimately being forced to sell fewer tickets.

Roadhogbc: I think the issue with bringing up kids in apartments in this country has much to do with climate. A lot of Canadian homes have basements or otherwise sufficient room to allow for indoor activities when the outside weather is inclement. In contrast to many European cities, where kids can go outdoors to play for much of the year, the weather in cities like Toronto and Vancouver, which feature among the mildest of Canadian climates, discourages outdoor activity for about six months of the year.

Retired state employees go on Medicaire and the pension fund picks up their supplemental insurance. I maen that for years the rule was the pension fund picked up 6 percent return. If it didn't the state supposedly made it up. If it was over 6 percent the state skimmed the surplus. As to a summary of benefits, look at what I said above. The state has a formula, salary plus 30 percent for benefits. They budget on that basis. It does not account for copays, the mostly self funded pension fund, and state employees don't use paid days off, and no one replaces them so there is no cost. (Except DOE substitute teachers).

Kukuinunu has raised an important point. Fighting discrimination has nothing to do with fighting inequality and the commitment to identity politics just reflects the commitment to free market economics that end up exploiting the majority (no matter what gender or color). Identity politics is bad for the very identities it is supposed to protect. You know you are in a world that loves free market economics and politics when SOME people of color or women get rich or become CEO's (or professors ), and this is regarded as a victory for all the people of color or women who aren't. It isn't discrimination that has produced the growing economic inequality in the U.S. (or Hawaii).

If you need 20k, then those last thousand units will be hard to sell, meaning they'll be delayed.  To drive down prices you need to glut the market, and that makes added supply unsellable, meaning they won't get built under our current development regime (which is actually quite hostile to units being built on spec).

My only conclusion concerning your post is you are unhinged. Wow. Quoting the days of NIXON?

The closest natives to ANWR MIGHT total 500, and I believe that number is high. \nOh, and if you want to follow this up with some rational effort, please visit the beautiful headquarters of the Billion dollar + Arctic Slope Regional Corporation located on C street in Anchorage - go inside and talk to all the natives in the building to gain their perspective on oil development on the Slope, then get back to us, after they provide a stiff dose of reality.

It means making choices about the future of the country of which one is a citizen -- choices that affect all Canadians, whether we pay taxes, live abroad all or part of the time, own property in Canada, etc.\n\nAccording to you, only those people who pay income tax should be allowed to vote.

Abortion is not defined as anything other than the removal of an implanted embryo, blastocyst or fetus.  There is no such thing as an abortion prior to implant and in fact most zygotes never implant in a woman taking no hormones or using any BC.  When an embryo does not implant that is not a death of a person or a person with a soul.  It certainly is not murder or Mother Nature would be guilty of mass murder every day.  An Embryo is a structure created by the unification of sperm and egg or the insertion of a skin, or other cell, into an evacuated ovum and then stimulated to divide.  So each and every cell in the human body has a potential to become a pluripotent embryo.  When does this structure become a person or have a soul?  No church has been able to adequately define that.  There are some scientifically uniformed bishops who believe human personhood begins with the unification of human sperm and egg.  That is ridiculous as Mother Nature (God) does not murder....

Looking at the link provided about this debt several facts become readily apparent:\n1) this figure represents the combined debt of the state, counties and cities combined.\n2) the major component of this debt is repayment obligations for bonds used to finance things like roads and schools.\n3) another major source is pension obligations for future retirees who are subsidized by new employees.\nSo my question is: what's the point of your comment? Should we not issue bonds to pay for road and school construction? Should we renig on pension promises to public employees who spent their lives in public service?

I would guess they did read the story and they are commenting on the underlying issue not the symptom. The symptom is that people are willing to pay for private care which allows doctors to double-bill, the issue is that there is a lack of resources made available in our public system (which causes two year waiting lists which could be a death sentence).\n\nIf you only address the symptom, so you somehow stop the use of private care in Canada the issue still exists. So people either live in a bubble and stay on the list with many dying or they are free to move and just buy the care in another country (possibly at a higher fee and definitely more when you factor in travel and stay). Rather than try to address the symptom, fix the system causing it.\n\nGeorge and Athelene I would argue are correctly identifying the issue, emwatcher stopped short of critical thinking.

Most of all he was a Romanticist and an Oregonian.\nBooks: Reed's three great books, to me, are:\n""Adventures of a Young Man: Short stories from life""  Very sensitive perceptive  stories of his youth and young adulthood, including some from Portland.\n""Insurgent Mexico""  He rode with Pancho Villa, loved their romantic revolution, but realized they had no plan or organization to put their  dreams into reality.\n""Ten Days that shook the World""  The book that made him famous, considered one of the great histories of the Russian revolution, for he felt the Communists had the plan the Mexicans had lacked.\n(Also see Wikipedia and ""Reds"")"	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]	en	xenos2021

"""Everyone has a right to acquire healthcare. No one has a right to have someone else pay for it.""\n\nActually, this is not true.

So those who need emergency services do have a right to have someone else pay for it.\n\nWhat about non-emergency care?  Some may argue that only emergency care should be provided, but what sense does that make?

Ken: I'm struck by the fact that you haven't asked anyone (apparently) why - what is so important - the Senate Republicans are taking such a drastic measure, and I agree it is and was surprised but pleased they took this stance, as there appears to be no other leverage to get dems to listen and negotiate. Have you spoken to Senator Warner or others to really understand the impact Hirst has on our state? I have been monitoring SB 5239 since February, where the House democrats repeatedly kick the bill back to the Senate without even trying to negotiate. And the bill simply rewrites legislation to put the State Dept of Ecology back in charge of water rights, they way it was before Hirst.  You know how this works - no old people will be deprived of meals on wheels, critical medical providers will continue to provide services without a contract and our children will get educated, etc. because this has happened before - when the budget gets approved, it will be retroactive.

But yeah, bottom line is that being less than two hours out, this particular A330 should have made it back to Australia on one working engine without serious difficulty.\n\nAs for why the pilot (apparently) did not shut off the engine that (presumably) suffered a broken fan or turbine blade, well, I dunno.

The potential to attack from Level 6 down onto passengers on Level 5 can easily be eliminated right now by simply installing the tall glass panels shown in the preview video.  Another option would be erecting a ballistic glass canopy over the screening queues.  That would then reduce the problem to preventing attack from Level 5 itself, which as you point out can be done with a focused security presence.  There should be more watchful eyes focused on the various entrances anyway, as there are many avenues into the building and plentiful opportunities to create carnage that don't even involve the checkpoint queues.  In fact, under the proposal the southern third of the terminal would remain outside security to serve non-passenger meeters/greeters.  This in itself would create a more concentrated mass of people who would be unprotected, turning the current advantage of crowd dispersal throughout the terminal's vast space into a liability.

I understand the temptation to think about this in terms of party.  Two problems.  One - I do not want to see this happen to our health care system, even to those who brought it on themselves by voting for this narcissistic, self-centered time bomb.  Many people have been conned through the years, and did not deserve the fate they helped cause.  Any benefit to party is not worth it.  Second, people vote more and more poorly if they are in pain, and are much more vulnerable to making bad decisions based on fear and hate.  The republican party has proven masters of exploitation of this.  Millions of people in rural poverty have benefitted from Obama care but still bought into the lies about it.  No matter how clear we think the outcome will be, it will not be that clear to many voters, and more pain will only lead to more lies about who is to blame, and many will continue to believe the massive con.

I'm not saying owning is always better than renting, but a couple factors you didn't consider, is the home in the long run will go up in value, considerably more in the last 5 years, where as the cost of renting will also only go up, and you will have nothing but cancelled checks in the end.  You may argue that every renter is wise enough to invest the difference between mortgage & rent payments, but we all know that's not the case. The home is also appreciating tax free.

By the way, Mythman, I personally believe that every single illegal alien present in the United States should be rounded up, reviewed for legal justification to stay, and if none shipped out immediately.  Illegal aliens are breaking the law.  There's really no legal justification in my mind that permits them to stay.  I also believe it would be fair and legal to put a moratorium on travel from ALL countries of the world as a matter of policy (just not some).  I think, however, that banning travel from all countries would have catastrophic economic effects on the US, and a ban on travel by Japan nationals and Chinese nationals in particular would devestate Hawaii economically (could there be a pretext for banning a country from which Hawaii enjoys high tourism numbers?  Yes.  That is what,  I think motivates Chin's efforts, in part).   Just don't discriminate or exclude based on an immutable trait, by presuming an immutable trait is per se evidence of bad behavior.

You mean like the repeated retractions happening after hysterical claims from the media have been proven wrong over and over and over again?  THAT and obvious bias for Clinton or the DNC, is what kills media credibility in the eyes of so many.  If we wanted Democrat talking points we would go to the Democrats for those.

Good Morning Skeexix,  Go it alone means theoretically, the US is uniquely positioned geopolitically, literally and existentially to need no other nation to survive (not counting a full on nuclear exchange which nobody wants) and be better off relatively than any other nation who threatens us or wants something from us.  For the few resources our country does need, we have the cash, market, manufacturing ability, and military power to acquire them.  Now that doesn't mean we want events to degenerate to that point (that's what negotiations and diplomacy are all about) but when we walk into the room, that is our bottom line.  And we often are the only one's in the room who don't know that.  America first!	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

Inject a little fear here, a boost of goodwill there, and VIOLA! they get their credits and subsidies for at least five good money-guzzling years!!

Well, first, it was selective leaks only from Democratic officials' email accounts. If the Russians or others hacked GOP official emails, we never saw them, purposely. They likely were every bit as personal and potentially embarrassing, but the intent was to swing public opinion against Democrats, of whom the Russians and our other enemies were more afraid.\n\nSecond, the Podesta and other Democratic emails weren't actually as horrible as the right wing noise machine twisted them into after going into hyper-distortion mode. I read them. What was the problem in them? Most people didn't read them, they just relied on the mischaracterizations of them by the right wing media and professional liars.

We shouldn't conflate the Arar and Khadr cases. The differences are substantial - especially with respect to the complicity of the Canadian government. In Arar's case it was an overt negligent act that triggered the rendition to Syria and torture of a wholly innocent person. Its missteps in Khadr's case were less egregious.

And cons also fall back on the nonsense about humanity being 'crooked timber' when they're not falling back on the equally nonsensical notion of sin. Harper and Scheer and the like have nothing valuable to offer a progressive society in this regard. I wish they both lived in those lovely gated and patrolled communities they have in Texas.

However, the Supreme Court specifically noted in Morguard the need in the modern world economy “to facilitate the flow of wealth, skills and people across state lines in a fair and orderly manner.” As such, these cases must be considered in assessing the issue of the enforcement of foreign judgments in Canada.\n\nCanada’s lower courts have almost universally applied the Morguard principles of enforceability to judgments originating outside Canada’s borders.

This post I made is a bit embarrassing but I can handle it.  You are correct about Senator Bennet not voting to end fracking. He actually supports fracking with limits as do I.

But I admit it is no fair to condemn him on votes he hasn't taken.  \n\nThe Senate wasn't allowed to vote on the merits of the Iran Deal because Senator Bennet VOTED to sustain the filibuster which prevented an open discussion and an up-or-down vote on Obama's reckless unverifiable deal with Iran.  \nHe thus voted not to block the deal.  http://graphics.wsj.com/table/IranDealWhipList_0815\n\nObviously all you need to know about the ACA is that without massive governmental subsidies it doesn't float.

"Yes, Doc.  The bottom line is this: until RE sales are contingent on scrutiny of income taxes paid, there will be no meaningful tracking of foreign money that is funnelled into housing, property or anything else.

Surely John Andrews could have pointed that out.

I believe you're likely correct. Khadr's lawyers obtained SCC judgments that established a prima facie case that a Charter violation had occurred and on this basis obtained injunctive remedy for such. But establishing civil damages is another matter altogether. This issue should have proceeded through and been concluded in the courts, where the issues of the applicability of the Charter in matters of national security, particularly where third parties like the U.S. are involved, as well as the extent to which individual behavior can be held to mitigate Charter-related damages (i.e. moral hazard) should have been determined. In an era where the government is seeking to prevent others from joining terrorist organizations abroad, the costs of pursuing this case in the courts, whatever the outcome, would have been minor in comparison to the value of judicial clarity. The settlement, meanwhile, leaves Canadian taxpayers unprotected and exposed.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

To answer the first question the first question. The goal of NCLB was for all students to meet the criteria for 'proficiency' (which was defined by state testing and attendance data) by 2012. Starting in 2002, schools were evaluated on the basis of these tests, and a cut score was used to determine whether or not adequate yearly progress was made. If progress was not made, the schools were sanctioned. The more years the schools did not meet AYP, the sterner the sanctions. The percentage of student proficiency was raised a certain percentage every year, until 100% proficiency was the goal. As predicted, no schools had 100%  of students performing at grade level in 2012, so they rewrote the law, and now we have ESSA. \n\nAlso, the measurement instrument changed several times over the years, bringing into doubt the reliability and validity of the evaluation.

Even a small real estate correction will knock a hundred grand off each's net worth. Go back to year-ago valuations, and their net worth is halved. \n\nI would also argue that the commuted value of a DB pension plan is also meaningless since it's not liquid either, and should be considered in terms of retirement-era cash flow rather than lump sum value, akin to CPP or OAS, neither of which are assets in their own rights. \n\n When you look at their actual liquid assets, he's worth 19k and she's worth 36, or 19k once the car is paid off.

"Yes, RI, ""the stagnant middle class after a decade of Harper's failed policies"" was one of the more effective as well as misleading of the Liberals 2015 campaign spins.   Indeed, the two Cs from Ottawa posters here are still touting that one.\n\nThe reality is in the twenty years from 1996 the Canadian middle class has seen a higher net increase in incomes and wealth than any other middle class of any other major developed country.  The New York Times (hardly a conservative rag) carried a report in 2014 declaring Canada to have the most affluent middle class among these countries.\n\nThe Liberals cleverly mislead the public by comparing the Harper years with selected previous decades of growth in Canada and declaring the Harper years wanting.  What they left out were such critical points as that all major developed countries had stagnant or negative growth in the post 2008 Great Recession years but Canada did better than the rest.

They do need another bat especially in the OF and one that wasn't left handed would really help the line up.  Not sure why every one expects Dahl to come back and be a superstar yet he is injury prone and has had very limited number of bats.  He is essentially still in spring training and won't really be ready to contribute until middle of August. Trading Tapia, McMahon, and Castellani would be a very reasonable prospect package for Ozuna.  People forget that Reynolds was supposed to be a part time player and he has slumped due to overplaying this season.  With Ozuna or McCutchen the Rockies could still split time for Parra/Cargo/Desmond in the outfield and at 1st.\n\nWith that said, the Rockies really need 2 arms in the bullpen and Neshak probably will not be one of them.  Ramos is not a bad alternative.  They are not trading for a SS.  Catcher would be the cheapest acquisition to make which leads me to think that is the way they go for a bat.

Thirdly, back in ~2010, the State Historical Preservation Div. gave the City the thumbs up to treat the 4 phases of the rail project as 4 projects for completing archaeological surveys.  At the time, the City had completed surveys for the first 3 phases and was getting ready to do phase 4 (urban HNL).  Based on the direction of the State, the City decided to start construction on phase 1 rather than wait the 4-5 months it would take to survey phase 4. I didn't like that decision at the time because that opened the door for potential legal challenges, but the City thought it would save time and money.  This led to the lawsuits that shut construction down for 18 months and led to tens of $millions in change orders.  Even worse, that delay held up inking contracts for phase 3 and 4, and during that 18 month period Honolulu's construction market exploded along with labor and materials costs.  I think that single decision probably set HART back 3-4 years & may end up costing $1-2 billion.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

America's public education system, until Reaganites started dumbing it down in the 80s, was the envy of the world, had produced the world's most-admired middle-class, and the most great scientists, statesmen, and entrepreneurs, up until that time.    The main exception is that poor and minority education has slipped badly, and everyone knows  -  but conservatives won't admit  -  that that phenomenon has more to do with the students' (and the school's) zip code, and the incomes and opportunity of those residents, than with the conservatives' false idols of inadequate teacher training, over-adequate union power, or unconcerned teachers.   Maybe conservatives, and Mme.

All the above points are good ones.  If I may add a few.  The German army was badly overextended ( which is the natural vulnerability of Blitzkrieg) and its supply lines were in danger of being cut.

Not buying your argument. As far as PTSD is concerned, my wife is in the counseling field and I'm well aware of how PTSD is diagnosed and treated. Viagra is typically not one of the remedies. There is a distinct mental health process that occurs in mitigating PTSD and Viagra is by far not one of the remedies. There are a whole host of medications considered before Viagra, but mental health counseling is THE primary remedy. Also, if you weren't aware, PTSD can be triggered from gender dysphoria as well, so you're actually making the case for transgender coverage if that's your argument.\n\nFinally, cite the percentage of Viagra distributions that are related to PTSD-related conditions.

"Voter fraud and voter suppression are very, very different things.  Voter fraud...persons who do not have the legal right to vote and vote anyway has been repeatedly shown to be statistically non-existant.

It is the systematically applied strategy of using every available tactic to keep people who have the legal right to vote from voting.

Tactics like ""voter roll purges"" wherein everyone having the name of a felon is removed from the rolls and has to prove they are not that felon in order to get re-registered.  Tactics like having fewer voting booths in precincts which are ""Democratic""; tactics like shortening hours, closing the polls even though there are citizens waiting to vote; tactics like refusing to have early hours so individuals can vote w/o having to take time off from work.

Perhaps it is because the AHCA will drive the already high private sector individual market health care premiums to the moon. Why?, because keeps the pre-existing condition clause, ends the mandate, and reduces the subsidies for those that qualify for them, and makes even fewer eligible for subsidies. The age tax goes from 300% to 500%. What does this mean? Many fewer healthy people in the pool, and about the same number of people with expensive health conditions that will do anything to remain covered, like take out a second mortgage or cash out retirement savings.\n\nAlaska has uniquely expensive health care. This isn't Alabama. Or Ohio. The AHCA is a disaster for Alaskans in the individual market, particularly those of us approaching Medicare age.

My point is precisely that we should not wait, but that we should plow ahead with the most obvious and overwhelming technology. This is a good example (as was the Internet not so long ago) of how profitability wrecks the best of social intentions. Waiting until somebody figures how best to extract value from a social need or want, you make it possible for the same to ring-fence the resources for their exclusive use and cut out anybody that does not have the funding to access them.\n\nTrust me, that's precisely how TICSA and Internet Solutions excluded me from participating in their power games. It is being an underdog that makes me realise why powerful interests prefer to keep me there. It also happens to be how the black elite chooses to deal with whites, who now expect that lack of fairness not to cross the race boundary, for reasons of a newly-discovered need for fairness.\n\nWhen it comes to water, do we really want South African Breweries to get a monopoly on extracting it?

Jim; I agree with you that the govt control of healthcare is way less than perfect, the treatment of Veterans and Native Americans, the mentally ill and addiction treatment all come to mind as being in need of fixing. However there are countries where healthcare works at less cost than what we are paying with better results.\nI have trouble finding a Dr. that accepts Medicare but every paycheck I am still paying for Medicare. Congress reduced the amount of payment to providers so they quit providing service.\nOur pay to play system is to blame for putting cooperate profits ahead of healthcare for Americans, until congress starts to actually exhibit real leadership we are stuck. Maybe now, instead of considering the present as a failure we consider it as the first step to real progress on healthcare.\nThe banking industry is in the same boat, banks were deregulated and so we got to bail them out , is it three times now.

Yes, I've ridden Portland light rail.  It crawls through town like a bus, but picks up to freeway speeds once it gets out of town and to places like the airport.  It's way faster that driving on the 205 during any rush hour and the 205 is way more packed than the H-1 is daily.  The problem I see is that it's an honor system to actually purchase a ticket because no one checks and there is no barriers to getting on/off, so possibly like our proposed system fares will not support even a small fraction of the cost of rail.  I'm not sure of Portland's numbers, but rail seems lightly used for the population base and really only makes sense for those that are going point to point without side or multiple points.

There a number of invasions there.

The Anglo Saxons later overran the Roman remnants, and dominated, linguistically and politically, for a couple of centuries.  The Norman French (who spoke a Scandinavian-influenced variety of French - they were mainly descended from earlier Viking invaders to Northern France) were less successful in dominating the Saxon remnants, particularly in the more Northern areas.

The article's assertion that rotenone kills only fish is not true. Your assertion that rotenone can target ALL gill breathing life, including insects is also false. The response of aquatic invertebrates and amphibians to rotenone over the short- and long-terms is extremely well-studied. Rotenone kills SOME gill-breathing invertebrates, but many species and life history stages are invulnerable, especially with concentrations and durations applied in current practice. In reality, rotenone gives multivoltine invertebrates such as midges, blackflies, and Baetis mayflies a short-term advantage, as these invertebrates explode in biomass within weeks after rotenone treatment. Potassium permanganate is toxic, but for a duration, and it oxidizes rotenone within 30 minutes travel time. \n\nThe prodigious ability of aquatic invertebrates to recolonize following disturbance has been known to science following seminal studies in the 1960s.

I agree with much of your post except the part about not allowing younger siblings to enroll.  As a practical matter, having all one's children in the school your family has chosen is important.  I have had my kids in a charter school although for various reasons including age difference, both went through the lottery.  Observing that school's enrollment over the years, the admission of siblings did not significantly reduce the spots available for the lottery. Some siblings were placed in public or private because the school wasn't a good fit for that particular child.  But it was the parent's choice.\n\nI do agree that schools should not be able to charge increased tuition because there are vouchers.  That's part of what has caused obscene inflation in higher education once the government started paying for it. As far as contributing time - many private schools are successful in part because of the community aspect created by parents working on projects together.

Generals running a war without congressional oversight is inherently dangerous.  So no forecasting of troop movements - but the opposition will know when and where and will count them as they land. NATO probably has no interest in Afghanastan. As to Afgan leaders - oh um.  The only way to finish this is to win over the population.

Today was a good example as Bud pulled Holland and replaced him with McGee. Let Holland work out his slider and bring him back or leave McGee there if he excells. Bud could play Valaika more for Story and Tapia more for Cargo. Bud could even switch Tapia or DJ into the lead off. No doubt there are risks and trade offs for every decision, yet that it why Bud was hired (to make the tough decisions). One of the most important lessons I learned from coaching was the best players/coaches are able to make the adjustments (not afraid to mix it up) when things are not working and get back on track (staying one step ahead). It certainly is not easy, most cannot do this consistently (I wasn't) which is what separates good from great. If the Rockies are to be a successful postseason team, Bud Black will need to make adjustments to get this group of players to play like they started the season.

Nurse is a hard job.

Years ago, illegal immigrants came to America for opportunity, and today, some still do.

America does not need millions of unskilled, poorly educated, non-English speaking immigrants who have no desire to work or assimilate. Our classrooms are overcrowded. Many hospitals in the southwest have closed because by law they had to treat anyone who needs emergency care. Illegals have used our ER's as doctors' offices, and almost none of them pay their hospital bills. The information that has consistently gone unreported is the many hidden costs of illegal immigrants. Our news media for decades have promoted sad stories of noble, worthy immigrants.

If you have to ask why the Nazis were the worst evil to rise in this world since Gengiz Kahn - and far worse than anything else in the past 200 years, then you are merely displaying your ignorance of both the Nazis and whatever you think may be comparable.\n\nFirst ask yourself this: Why was murder in communist dictatorships worse than the brutal murders in every capitalist dictatorship - Pinochet's Chile for example had tens of thousands of people dissapeared. Every evil you can name from Stalin he did - in the most capitalist country that has ever existed.  Could it be that it is dictatorship that is the cause of those evils - not any particular economic policy ? Because that's the only logical explanation.\n\nSecond: ask yourself why you have so little respect for  the people you debate that you serious thought I would be impressed by something as silly as a tu quoque fallacy ?

Yes I realize the teams that wanted to play him. He never saw the field for the Pats regular season. How can you possibly groom Tebow to succeed Brady? That would never happen. My point is a team making their offense fit to Tebow or Lynch's talents. The Jets GM got fired for making the trade for Tebow if I remember right. The Eagles were the only team that was ready to make plays for him but they realized the concussion issues and backed off. Osweiler is also in the same boat. I'd say Kaepernick is borderline but he has experience. One of the few running QB's right now that has his coach behind him is Russell Wilson. His talent is immense. He is a guy you just leave alone and let play.\n\n In my opinion there are some QB's that just want to do things they feel most comfortable with and struggle too much with the playbook and reads on the field.

"Yes, the individual mandate is necessary for risk pools - not just for the old but those with pre-existing conditions and the unhealthy. It is irresponsible if you don't have insurance.

To equate young and healthy is completely inaccurate in this country.\nYou know obesity is an epidemic, right? Rates of colon cancer is rising fastest in young people (30's). They get sick. There is an attitude among young people that they don't need health care, when they do. It costs taxpayers when people go to the emergency room and/or  are unable to pay for the care they receive.

The 2 atomic bombs saved far more American and Japanese lives by bringing their Warlords to their knees. Truman saved lives in dropping them and demonstrated to Stalin the 'new' power we possessed.\n.\nSo if someone 'chooses' to kill that's Ok?......Alright.  Well then, if our military takes your advice, the N Koreans and probably many others will 'choose' to abort us.  All of us. With nukes and gas and chemical and biological and nerve agents.  That would be their 'choice' And like a helpless, innocent baby, we do nothing, right?   You support that ?  We're in 'their' world and they want us 'out'.  I think I would  put up a fight, with a few other Americans, even if it means defending people like you and others on the left, who seem very determined to throw in the towel and start hugging their own executioners.

MichaelG, there is a simple and easy to understand answer to your question. It is the Constitution of the United States.  It used to be taught in schools, but I don't think that is done any more.  It gives the President authority to pardon anyone for crimes against the United States except in cases of impeachment.  It does not allow presidents to make or change laws as Obama did when he issued his Executive Order creating DACA.  Trump is merely restoring Constitutional law to the U.S. government.

Having money in the corporation that you're intending on using is different from holding money in a corporation because you'd rather not take it out in dividends or in a salary and pay the personal tax on it.  The measures are designed to curb the second reason.

Well, I agree with you that after we ordain women & take care of the sin & abuse against all women created by a form of discrimination that teaches women they are less sacred, less worthy, less complete Christians, than men, that there is no reason to keep people called to priesthood from being ordained simply because they are married.  However, this discrimination does not constitute any injustice because many faiths demand sacrifice.  So although I don't have a problem with changing this after women are ordained equally to men to the exact same unrestricted Holy Orders & Sacrament as celibate men, this should never be allowed before women are being ordained priests. This would constitute gender segregation and the complete oppression of all women by all men in our church. This is a worse sin than we are already committing by allowing the gender discrimination to continue at all.  \n\nI would picket against any parish that had an ordained married man as one of its priests in the U.S.	[0, 0, 0, 1, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

Gary, I agree, silliness is too casual a word, yet the U's behavior APPEARS not the act of serious minded people.  It has a peculiar childlike quality: ten-year-olds crashing about knocking the lamps over and wondering why there is suddenly no light.  That has become more common at universities in general, not just the UO.\n\nI suspect that only litigation can pry the lid off this green-and-gold crypt.

The police would still close the streets for hours and hours.  Besides, videos aren't dispositive.  They can be somewhat deceptive depending on the angle and position of the camera and other factors. And are subject to interpretation.  That's why people are opposed to red light cameras.  Police officers observations can also be faulty depending on the traffic law.  For example, a lot of police officers seem to think if they look up and see you crossing on a red light, you have broken the law, but that is not what the law says.  The law says you can't enter an intersection w/ a red light if the light was red when you crossed the stop light or the fictional line caused by the curb intersection unless you couldn't have stopped safely.  The same with the new law saying you can't begin to cross a street where the walk signal (if any) has begun to blink red.  An officer must see you  doing so, not simply in the street, making the law unenforceable unless officers stretch the truth.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

You did not say 30-40% profit, that's true. But you did suggest profits were the culprit. When if fact even with these premium increases, their profits are likely to stay in the same basic range they are now (like Cigna's 5.5%). Just like they have after years of large premium increases.  The point being, profits aren't the culprit.  COSTS are.\n\nYour math on the PREMIUM increases is correct. I was never disputing that part. Only the suggestion that it was about profits, when it's actually about costs. \n\nI disagree about major changes to what we have now not doing any better at controlling costs, however. I definitely think there are ideas that would better control costs compared to this. Heck, it couldn't be much worst than what we've had for the last decade. Costs have been SOARING.  That's why so many insurers have pulled out of Obamacare exchanges - because they can't recover their soaring costs, even with high premium increases.

Actually, there is a strong case that taxes do subsidize businesses which pay wages low enough for full-time employees to qualify for numerous government benefits. \n\nA one bedroom apartment in Denver is just under $1400/month (median).

(A Walmart cashier, according to Glassdoor, makes about $10.50/hr) There are numerous reports that Walmart informs its employees of how to secure government benefits. \n\nCEO pay has increased 90 times more than average worker pay since 1978 ( and twice as much as stock prices).

Perhaps a look at Father Reese's NCR article in April 2011 would clarify. He pinpoints a lack of satisfaction with worship as the reason 70% of Catholics who become Protestants give for doing so. Approximately half of US Catholics who leave the Church do so to become Protestants. That's millions. Of course, there are other reasons, everyone is different, but surely to say so does not constitute Revisionism. Naturally, Father Reese does not blame the banishment of the Latin Mass (though interestingly he does acknowledge that is the case for 11 % - a good argument against his advocacy of renewed banishment at least). Balance would have been to include the material from his earlier article in this one. As to bias, I have a different opinion based on a different interpretation. That's not bias.

With the 'average'  results we get from education dollars they should be forced to  build a school on land they already own, or just  forget it. If they don't have any land  just add more stories to their existing schools, or go down. There's unlimited space going down.

You are correct.  Most of  the words of the Courts and Military are of French extraction because the Norman conquerors ruled them.  The animals in the fields tended by the Anglo Saxon serfs still have Anglo-Saxon names cow, sheep, pig etc but the choice food on the table that the Normans saw have French names, beef, steak, mouton, porc , fillet, etc .  The poorer cuts still  have the English names.  French was the official language of the Courts, the Administration, the Royal Court, the land , the church (with Latin) until a Coronation in the 13th Century when  for the first time in 200 years the language used was English.    English survived not because  of language police but because the people wanted it to and they weren't  afraid to incorporate large amounts of the French, Swedish, Danish, German, Latin,  into it.

"Thanks for making my point. If the Americas human population derived from migrants coming from the North to South then obviously Sealth and all local Indian tribes are direct forbearers of the tribes to the South. Hence they are ""coming home"" to the land of their greater grandfathers. There is also evidence that migrants arrived by sea or even air from Polynesia or elsewhere in the globe but this is all prehistorical and only speculation based on giant patterns created on the ground only visible from the sky, and similarities in pyramid design and layout, and engineering feats such as precisely cut & fitted huge blocks of stone that we cannot duplicate even with modern equipment and technology. But again, the historical evidence is absent, other than Incan admissions that the huge stoneworks were not done by them, but by those who came before them.

Where i work - everyone has at least an M.Scc and most of them a Ph.D. and there is absolutely NO training for the jobs. The thing is, to take some one from ""not qualified"" to ""fully qualified"" would be 5 or 6 years. Foreign trained individuals can, in many cases, jump right in - i.e., they do not need the 5 or 6 years of training because they have had it elsewhere. The Canadian worker, however, has never had that ""training"" and so simply cannot compete. If the available jobs could be filled by ""existing Canadians"" they would be. The problem is that the ""existing Canadians"" simply lack the 5-6 years of required training. And yes i, too, think it sucks. But that is the way it is."

When you speak of endangered birds are you referring to the Hawaiian petrel?

As far as insisting that there should  be preferential treatment for native Hawaiian wildlife by killing off other animals such as free-roaming cats in order to protect them, this argument flies in the face of many Hawaii residents who staunchly believe Native Hawaiians should NOT receive preferential treatment despite the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy by non-natives.  In fact, Native Hawaiians receive disparate treatment in Hawaii's criminal justice system just as African Americans receive disparate treatment in America's criminal justice system, serving longer prison sentences in comparison to other races.

State is trying to take the long view, remembering that the Shah of Iran was going to be the stabilizing force in the M East, before the Sunni boss took the country over. A little known fact is that at time during the war, the US was actually allied with Mao over the Nationalists on the theory Mao was better disposed to fight the Japanese.

The Lib government is doing a fine job of ignoring and flubbing all kinds of policy promises and issues.

Are you implying that the Indigenous people of Canada are not Canadians and do not share that wealth? I get it that poverty stalks many of their communities but there is a share of blame for that resting with them. We all make choices and as adults we know we have to face the consequences of those choices, good and bad. Children don't get that but it is only those who refuse to grow up who become embittered by the injustices they have faced, and which in their minds continue. I like to think indigenous people are now growing into our modern world and that their communities are becoming more vibrant and attractive as more of them figure out how they can make their own way and  contribute as individuals to our shared human experience. Very few (if any) of us can control what happens to us. All of us however have full control over how we react and if we act as adults and perceive challenges as opportunities and seize them- they multiply and we realize rewards that are myriad.

Okay, here are a couple of  my qualifications. I was prescribed medication for high blood pressure by a doctor in Alberta about 20 years ago. He said I would have to take it for the rest of my life. Just prior to that he had prescribed a nasal spray for a sinus infection. When I read the information about the sinus medication, it said it raised blood pressure. When I stopped taking the medication, my blood pressure returned to normal, and never was high again. \nSecond example. My elderly mother in a care center was prescribed sleeping pills by a B.C. doctor, although she never had trouble sleeping, and had never asked for them. She was told they were necessary. When she found out they were sleeping pills, she refused to take them. No problem sleeping. \nThird example... I think you get the idea. But I have several more just in my family and circle of friends. \nYeah, some unethical doctors do take kickbacks.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

It's 82% of white homicides committed by other whites, not 90%.\n\nBut here's the difference. Blacks are only 17% of the population; whites are about 64%.  The number of homicides in the two groups pretty close to the same - whites' are higher, but not by a lot -- which means blacks are killing their own about five times more often than whites as a percentage of population.  Which makes it a significantly bigger problem for blacks.  It has a lot to do with drug dealing and gang activity.  Most of the victims are criminals themselves.

You're right.  Only about 35 members of the House and about 20-25 members of the Senate are genuine fiscal conservatives in line with Trump's agenda.  Most of the rest of them are members of the Progressive Establishment Cartel who want the status quo ... along with all of the Democrats who are part of the same Cartel.  They buy votes with irresponsible hand-outs paid for with debt, and don't want to solve any problems.  This will change in 2018.  This is not a cult of personality.

Why extend compassion to those who don't understand the meaning of the word or can't tolerate the potential effect of the effort?  I ask myself that question all the time and having no real answer so I keep on keeping on.  The groups you mention, KofC-which is really Carl Anderson, President Trump, American conservatism, are not interested in compassion, they are interested in promoting a political world view that is not particularly Catholic.  Carl Anderson really angers me because he is promoting a libertarian self centered political world view under the guise of a previously recognized truly compassionate Catholic organization.

There's no reason why men shouldn't work on status of women issues, same as there's no reason ""settlers"" shouldn't work on a committee about aboriginal issues.\n\nIn fact, it's interesting that the Conservatives removed Senator Beyak from working on the Senate aboriginal committee when she expressed views that opposed the treaty rights of aboriginal people.  IMO, if Ms Harder's political position is that abortion should be re-criminalized contrary to the rights of women, then she should similarly be disqualified from work on women's issues.  \n\nI don't care if Scheer nominates a man or someone who does not call himself a feminist to chair the committee, but I do expect committee members would at least support Charter rights for women, including the Charter right to abortion."

The EU is the glue that keeps Europe form desintegrating into its old Nationalist, warmongering ways.  While the League of Nations and the UN can't really keep states from each others' throats, at least the money, trade and freedom of travel does keep the member nations fairly closely unified and more prosperous than any of their non-EU neighbours.

The simple reason to single out assault rifles is that there is no good reason for anyone outside of the military or law enforcement to have one.  What they are is a toy that has the potential for causing mass murder.\nOn the mass shooting statistics I guess you have found a way to narrow the definition to get down below 100.  The FBI doesn't have a definition for what constitutes a mass shooting.  The Gun Violence Archive http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/ defines a mass shooting as one where at least one person is killed and at least four people are killed or injured, which seems like a  reasonable definition.  Based on their definition there have been 273 mass shootings in the US so far this year and considering that at least one person has to die per incident that would indicate that at least 273 have died, leaving out those victims who are injured.

My grandmother was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown after her husband died in 1959 after years with cancer -- leaving her with four kids, including a newborn. It had been a long and expensive illness and she'd been the sole breadwinner for years before (they lived in a small Alberta town and she took ten or more borders at a time and cooked three meals a day for all of them). She was from a family of 16 and started working in a rectory when she was 14 -- she wasn't entitled or a snowflake, but we all have limits. She recovered and supported the family -- but even years later, she couldn't sleep without a lot of Ativan.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

We've been scammed.  \nAfter reading the Annual Financial Report of the Government of Canada I couldn't figure out how the PBO assumed that the Federal Government budge was sustainable.  And then I found it.  The PBO (along with Trudeau) included the assets of all public pension plans (including CPP) as government assets.  Sorry, but these are not assets of the government, they belong to the people covered by the pension plans and cannot be used by the federal government.  They should not be included\nMy analysis shows that after Harper put us into a structural surplus Trudeau put us into a structural deficit.  Between 2015-16 and 2016-17 government revenues fell while expenses soared.  Clearly, if revenues are falling and expenditures are rising during periods of economic growth, what sort of mess will Canada be in during the next recession, and there will be one?  \nThis looks like the 1970s all over again.

What is amazing about several comments is the lack of information and understanding  of a few simple facts related to crude oil quality and its processing. The quality i.e composition of crude oils vary and is a significant factor in the economics of crude purchasing and refining.The heavy oil produced in Western Canada contains about 35% material that must be processed in a residue processing unit such as a Coker or Residue Processing unit . The refining capacity in Eastern Canada is about 1.1 million barrels with only about  25000 barrels of Coking/residue processing capacity in Ontario vs about 350,000 barrels in the 1.1 million barrels from the Energy East. Significant capital expenditure will be required by the existing refiners to increase processing of Canadian bitumen derived crude so impact of Energy East pipeline on reducing crude imports will be very limited.

Yes, that is my point. The “soft sounding” parts of scripture describe love, which can be filled with great hardships. \nMarriage is a place where people commit to suffering with Jesus for the sake of another person. It may sound soft, because its purpose is wonderful, an act of love and being loved. But hopefully every Christian knows love has many crosses that accompany the grace.\nBut why are you saying this as if you disagree with me? Remarried people can have marriages that reflect love brightly, bearing burdens that unmarried people would not consider. Bearing them happily because the blessings are so much greater than pain of the cross. \nAssuming the duties of marriage and children is so much better than staying alone, shaken by the pain of the first marriage and afraid to try again.

You see, how it works is that the President proposes, then Congress crafts the legislation, they talk about it, and then get it to the President's desk for signature into law. I don't know why the left continues to make a connection between health insurance and calls it health care. The health care industry is doing great in our country. ACA was designed to fail and drastically raise costs to the consumer and the providers of care. If even Medicare can't pay out to the providers in a timely and accurate manner, don't believe that ACA would do a better job.\nWait until those on the exchanges find out their premium rate costs will go up next year. Then maybe the left will see the folly of letting Mr Obama and the Democrats force all Americans to consume, or else.

"""A true Christian couldn't object""?  Is this not pretense?  Jesus said on many occasions that He was the only way.  If He was raised from the dead, which I believe He was, He has very much authority on true spirituality.  He said that he will be the judge of those in this world.  Julia's article is full of statements that are very extra Biblical.  What authority does she have to teach such things?  She claims that she is following Christ by being an apostate, but if you look at what Christ taught, its very evident that she is missing the mark of submission to Christs authority.  About the poor and needy, it should be our joy and mission in accordance with the gospel to serve their needs.  Forced giving by government or by the law is where the pretense seeps in.

Yeah the only problem with that theory is that it doesn't work in the real world.  The last election was about more and more of the economy getting funneled to the top few percent to the detriment of the rest.  The tax cut for businesses only adds to the problem.  Instead of funding more production and jobs what happens in the real world is that it funds more stock buybacks. The problems in the economy are on the demand side and worker skill levels not the supply side.  Targeted tax cuts that promote workforce training and apprenticeships might be something that will help the economy.  Eliminating other tax breaks that provide no real economic benefit while lowering rates by a like amount could make sense.  Eliminating or limiting the deduction of interest expense could help in the long run. There are reform ideas that make sense but all we see at this point is rate cuts.

@Ausexpat: There will be some pressure. Still, no one ever has to buy. Some people will always have to sell (e.g. job loss). If the pool of new buyers dries up, some people will have to slash prices until things sell. (The detached market has fallen VERY fast in some parts in 2017.) \n\nIf foreign $ can simply soak up all that demand, why would you assume those places wouldn't get added to the rental supply (particularly with moves against AirBnB)? Added to that, the would-be first-time buyers  (not tens of 1000s) don't live in a closed system. If it gets that bad, even more will simply not stay here. That means the exodus of essential talent and the future tax/ consumer base will grow bigger. \n\nIf that happens, I foresee more measures being taken to reverse that future-killing trend (either by spiking wages [more taxes/fees/higher prices for all, including you] or, more likely, creating more measures that begin reversing various pro-price increase real estate policies).

True, that's not what they're protesting.  But what so many other people don't understand is that it DOESN'T MATTER what they're protesting, because WHAT they're protesting is not the part that's pissing millions of people off.  It's HOW they chose to do it -- by choosing to disrespect the national anthem (and thus what it stands for).  THAT'S what's pissing millions of people off.\n\nIf they'd just chosen a different time and method for their protest (i.e. NOT during the national anthem, and most especially NOT disrespecting it by a blatant refusal to observe the standard protocol of respect by standing), then almost NONE of this backlash would be happening.\n\nAgain, WHAT they're protesting for is irrelevant to that issue.

I tend to agree with you Amazon would be a boost to Denver, not a life saver.  There is a lot of economic diversity around here that would survive just fine if Amazon ever left.  \n\nOne other thing to consider though, is that a big company like this is also likely to attract other businesses that support it.  Colorado is offering incentives but they are very limited and performance based. Also, the jobs that Amazon creates are not mostly going to be low salaried positions. There is a lot of tax revenue that will be generated by those salaries and the sales and property taxes those people generate.\n\nIMO, the biggest challenge for Denver winning this is the lack of infrastructure investment and city planning.  Another downside is the time zone thing. Amazon may very well want to have HQ2 in the Central or Eastern time zones.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

bavius,\n  The right and left do indeed exist, the form an ideological spectrum where the center, generally speaking, reflects the views held by the majority.  The right tends to express a desire to either return things to a so-called golden age or to preserve the status quo. The right also tends to place greater emphasis on laissez faire capitalist principles and the protection of private property/rights. The left tends to express a desire for greater equality in society, places greater emphasis on the good of the community, and sets its hopes and energies towards creating a better society for all to live in and therefore promotes change in this direction along social democratic and/or socialistic principles.

Smiling, I agree with some of that.   I've often wondered if the hard core feminist kinda ruined the special status that women had for the majority of men.   Then I think about what men really did, which was screw around a lot, categorize women as wives, sad spinsters, or sluts and completely underestimate the intelligence and potential  of women.   It took the fierce stand of feminist to get the attention of powerful males.\n\nWhat many feminist saw as the 'direction' of women was NOT the dream of all woman then, or now.   Millions of women aspire to the role as leader of the home life, the raising of their children, partnering with their husband to help him provide the shared income for all.    Other women dream of personal freedom, pursuit of their interest ranging from deep space science to throwing pots in Santa Cruz - in other worlds they deserve the same range of choices as men.\n\nThere should be no  shaming of women for making either choice (and some do both)	[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

"The affordable housing they should build is not simply a mandate, but instead is in exchange for added development potential - e.g. added stories, more coverage on the parcel, a bulkier building, etc.  I.e. they get to build more and make money off that, and in return they give back by offering housing at lower cost.   The term is inclusionary zoning. \n\nThe complaint is that the City, in its backroom deal called the ""Grand Bargain"", gave away a lot of development potential and is not getting enough affordable housing in return.  \n\nArguably 2% affordable - what is required downtown (and that is 2 of every 100 units needs to be ""affordable') - does not ""pay back"" fairly against the additional development potential given away."

There are some mainland hotels that do pay better wages and benefits than most hotels in Hawaii, but the wages and benefits paid by most mainland hotels are not better than paid here and are not as good in many places.

Actually they have cities, tall building and everything, even indoor plumbing.\n\nThe tradition goes back to the early Protestant/Calvanist I believe.  (Pella is Dutch Reform immigrants, very conservative).  \n\nOur early north American towns were built in squares for safety.   Town's were literally built in squares so that the neighbors could watch each other and that would give them strength from sinful behavior.   Could be old wives tale, but I think based on truth.\n\nPella neighbors trust each others, most don't lock doors (I never did).    Does it mean some snoopy people - sure.  Does it mean you won't rot in your house for two days before anybody notices, sure does.  Will neighbor's watch for your safety and property, they sure will.

When the Tsilqot'in decision was adjudicated by the SCOC the court agreed with the trial judge's opinion that title was proven.  The Chief Justice, who wrote the decision went on to reiterate in her own words what had been written in several past decisions..that first nations do not have a veto and that government can infringe on title for legitimate reasons.

According to PFF, they ranked Denver's Oline at #24 before the season, and at week 5 of the regular season, #16, in the middle, and nowhere near last. Week 5 is the most current ranking I could find today at pff.  \n\nThey have had a couple of subpar games last 2 outings, no question. Maybe they looked the worst, last weekend. PFF in week 5 has Seattle as having the worst OLine, then the Cards at 31, then the Jets, Bengals, Texans. And these other teams are all wranked worse than Denver: Colts, Giants, Dolphins, Niners, Bucs. Broncos aren't the worst, but the last 2 weeks, bad enough to cost us games, along with issues in gameplanning, coaching, qb play.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

No drugs or alcohol allowed in the shelters.  Remember that when you see these homeless on the 6 O' clock news and they refuse to be helped.

Discouraging tourists simply helps to cripple the economy while we run out of water. We need every cent to get other water sources online.	[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021
I commented on an article of what is happening in eThikwini.

Rebuttal would be on the issue in Durban to prove me wrong. You presented no rebuttal but complained about an unrelated incidence about you obviously want an answer from me. Why? Then just for effect you drag race into an argument of illegal conduct by municipalities as if you can read my mind and find me guilty of racism. The irrony is of course that it makes you a racist because you use race as argument for outcome of a debate. Your mind is somehow confused.

Will, nearly 1/3 of Oregon's forestland is set aside in reserve.  Included in that is almost 5 million acres of old growth.  \nThe Oregon Forest Practices Act ensures that every harvest is replanted, which is in everyone's best interest.  \n\nRight now, France is studying how we create and use renewable resources for building.  They have used non-renewable for a couple thousand years and it has wreaked havoc on their landscape.  Everything they use is dug out of the earth.  Stone, concrete, brick, steel and even glass permanently necessitate getting something from the earth that will never go back to nature.  The Burgundy region of France has a very similar climate to the Willamette Valley and they are very proud that they have studied us and now have a million acres of Douglas fir that they are sustainably harvesting.

As was mentioned elsewhere in the thread, McDonalds kept its coffee at 190 degrees, which was about 50-60 degrees hotter than the industry standard, and continued to do so despite as many as 700 reports of burns. The woman received third degree burns and nearly died.\n\nThe woman who spilled the coffee wanted just $20,000 to cover her estimated medical expenses. The jury suggested much more because McDonalds had continued to sell dangerously hot coffee despite knowing it was a hazard. The plaintiff settled for much less than the recommended $3 million value from a jury, a little over half a million.\n\nThis all gets glossed over because some very wealthy people want you to back them any time they gut a consumer's right to redress.

The secession of a state  does not  break up a country. Joining a confederation and leaving it should simply be achieved in the same  manner. Making use of a democratic process to determine the the sovereignty of a state makes sense.

The only other option is civil war and one would think that all of the people of Spain are aware of the disasterous events that accompanied their last bout of fratricide.\nThe notion that states or provinces are indentured to a confederation once they join ignores the fundamental foundation of the Western Dmocracies: freedom. \nThat said, a state or leader of a state that wishes to compromise or eliminate the freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution of a confederation for any of its constituents should be prevented from doing so by any means available to the confederation.

Actually, the US said the oil would be produced regardless of Keystone going ahead or otherwise so nixing it would have no impact on CO2 emissions.\n\nBut you're missing the point - Harper has no diplomatic skills and a track record of failure in US/Canada relations- he's not a serious source of advice.\n\nObama's a politician with a constituency- just like Harper.  Only one of those constituencies was happy with the political outcome of Keystone.  Harper was so peeved he cancelled the 3 Amigos Summit - not a diplomatic bone in his body.

"R&R\nThe list of issues you mentioned rings true, but I seriously doubt the answer is to somehow turn back the clock, nor is it to try to legislate or externally control ""reproductive choice."" The simple truth is that part of the reason reproductive choice even became a societal issue/concern at all, was the underlying treatment of women.  \n\nI suspect that most (even the ""pro choice"" crowd) in their hearts are not comfortable with abortion. At the same time, the church's position on ABC is so extreme that it has been soundly rejected by faithfully married Catholics pretty much ever since Paul VI issued HV.\n\nI abhor abortion. But I do not see the availability of abortion as being the ""accelerant"" for the societal fires of pornography, infidelity, weak marriages and families. I think we need to look deeper at those questions. Removing abortion won't fix those problems. Changing attitudes and values might.

The world we live in is at a crossroads where if we don't change our ways of doing business and living styles 180 degrees in industrialized nations- the biosphere will collapse.  Saving existing forests and helping restore more here in the Pacific Northwest is a critical component to help us mitigate the worst effects of global warming.  This is what the most respected scientists are telling us.  We simply cannot ignore the truth of what devastation burning fossil fuels, clear cutting forests, chemical big agriculture and concentrated animal feeding operations do to our natural systems that support all life and commerce.  Keep logging to private lands that are already tree farms.  NO public forest should be logged unless it is a benefit to the health of the forest.

The answer is always more government money funding these things, isn't it? Or is it? The fact is that Adam Lanza's parents were wealthy. The father is a millionaire and the mother (divorced) was getting at least $300k per year in alimony payments, and didn't really have to work for a living. If little Adam was having mental issues, the parents had MORE than enough money to pay for psychiatric treatments out of pocket; no government saviors needed. Yet the kid still goes on a rampage anyway. All that Lanza family money for mental illness treatment didn't keep those poor first graders alive.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

When Pope John Paul allowed the local bishop to authorize (or decline to authorize) the celebration of the Tridentine Mass (Extraordinary Form), the bishop was required to make sure that both the celebrants and the members of the congregation affirmed both the validity and the authority of the Mass of Paul VI (Ordinary Form.) Pope Benedict made what I think history will judge as a serious pastoral error in extending the permission without continuing to protect those values and affirmations. I believe that Pope Francis would correct those mistakes if Benedict were not still living; and that he might yet correct them if Benedict pre-deceases him.\nOf more concern than the rite of the EF is the fact that those who celebrate it use a different liturgical calendar and a different lectionary from the rest of the church, both of which are gravely deficient by comparison.

So what?  We never disagreed with the Protestant reformers that we are saved by Grace alone. We also always agreed that justification (at least the initial work of justification) is not due to merit on our part but rather due to God's gratuity. That document just explained in modern terms what we have always believed--but may have been misunderstood by the Protestants. The disagreement is in whether God's Grace is operative in human works.  It is also in whether Christ's righteousness is infused vs. imputed. \n\nPope Benedict, likewise reflected in his speech what has always been believed by the Church but, again, has been misunderstood and misinterpreted by Protestants and Catholics alike.  Novenas, indulgences, miraculous medals and the like are all venerable tools of prayer---but not essential or central to Catholic spirituality. \n\nAnyone who has taken a basic theology class would know this---unless of course they went to a Jesuit university.

Yeah, that was rough. Not many teams get to transition from one top notch QB to another like Green Bay did with Favre and Rodgers. \n\nI'm thinking we'll see Lynch probably week 10 and they'll have him play out the remainder of the season to see what he shows. It does give me a bit of optimism that he'll grow given his limited experience and the strides taken by young guys like Wentz and Goff this season. I don't think he can grow until getting more experience with the game speed of the regular season. \n\nI don't see Denver going after an aging high priced QB unless Lynch completely flops and they don't think Kelly will be ready to take over. Though if Eli is out there, never say never. I think Palmer is done, can't see Brees leaving New Orleans and I don't think Dalton solves anything. Then salary cap issues arise too.  \n\nCould easily be another QB competition next camp with Lynch, Kelly and another vet.

Why should we favor displacing hundreds of thousands of people over helping them restore order in the place they came from (and would probably prefer to stay)? And why should we continue to overpay for health care services (with an unsustainable program to boot), rather than put people more in touch with the cost of their care, which will reduce our premiums, keep prices in check and increase the overall amount of health care we can buy? As for food stamps, when the economy grows and unemployment drops, there should be less need for such things. What circumstances have to exist before we can justifiably cut back on them?

I understand what you're getting at.  The old torts of assault and battery separated the crime into the attempt or threat of using force against a person versus the actual physical force, the battery component.\n\nBut it seems pretty clear in Canadian law that determining the actus rea of sexual assault under S271 requires there to be touching, that it was sexual in nature, and that there was no consent.  \n\nIt's only under S272 that threatening a sexual assault with a weapon is sufficient to establish the actus rea of sexual assault with a weapon.\n\nWhich is why I do believe a verbal threat of sexual touching (without a weapon) would be prosecuted, if at all, as a common assault.

If you've ever read my posts before, I've said that slavery wasn't the only issue involved in the civil war.  You are erring as much in the opposite direction. Your points show no research or thought.\n\n1. Lincoln didn't start the war by ignoring Dred Scott. In fact, though he argued against it, he didn't do anything about it.\n\n2. Buying slaves to free them wasn't an option in much of the south.  In fact it had become illegal in many places.  Before it was made illegal, there was a time when Quakers churches were some of the largest slave owners.  They bought or took possession of slaves so that they could free them. This was very disturbing to southerners.\n\n3. In 1861 there were 34 states.  15 were slave states.  The free territories also outnumbered the slave territories.  Although that is somewhat fuzzy as they weren't states yet, it could have changed. \n\n4. Slave ownership. 1860 Census. 32% of white families in the south owned slaves. 46% in South Carolina, 49% in Mississippi.	[0, 0, 0, 0],[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]	en	xenos2021

Trump has had zero effect on the American economy. It’s fallacy to credit Trump with any economic gains. All credit goes to Obama who took America out of the crash of 2008 and instituted job creation plans ( which was his election plank). \nThe stock market is doing well because companies are sitting on vast amounts of cash, much of it in safe jurisdictions overseas. Most major companies are waiting for the Republican tax proposals to take effect. \nLet’s talk in 3 years to objectively assess Trump’s effect on the American economy. And honestly ask yourself as a Trump supporter if your life has improved economically. I don’t see how it will help those in the lower/middle class.

Yes O-line is a major factor for QB’s but there have been some really good QB’s that played behind some less than stellar O-line. There are a handful of big plays that are open in every game regardless of line play and good QB’s make those plays. By making those plays you back 8 out of the box and allow for a few holes in the run game, which helps the pass game even more(It also helps the defense stay off the field longer). That’s why a great QB can still have success behind a bad O-line. All three of our QB’s are awful because their decision making is atrocious and they don’t hit those plays consistently when they are.

"""Reagan increased the flow of tax revenues from the wealthiest 10% by reducing their tax rates."" \n\nThat is indeed a ""simple"" (as in simple-minded) ""theory"" known as ""trickle-down"" which posits that lowering taxes on the wealthy will ""trickle down"" like urine onto the heads of working people. What is the mechanism by which lowering taxes increases revenues? And why not get more bang for the buck by lowering taxes on working people, instead of the wealthy? There are a lot more working people than rich people.\n\nYou have no link or source cited for your figures. Reagan's tax cuts also cut revenue, that's how Reagan tripled the national debt in eight short years.

The magic of macroeconomics supporting our current economy- internationally even- but the dissonance with microeconomics is driving many to personal distraction.

I agree with you completely. I too see  Pope Francis  working hard to modernize radical power-seeking political Catholics, Protestants and other such religions so they can do what they were really meant to do which is to be inclusive of all human beings no matter what their differences are. No two people are alike even to the point of their fingerprints and even voiceprints. The creator created all of us the way we are. That is why I am a Unitarian Universalist. Our congregations include every religion and non-religion under he sun. We celebrate all human beings and their right to worship or not, any way they wish. It makes for very interesting encounters and opportunity for learning about other cultures, beliefs and philosophies, etc. It is a very culturally rich and enjoyable environment.

It is mandatory by law in nearly every, if not every, state of the USA to shoot any dog on sight that is seen harassing wildlife. This is why feral dog-packs are a rarity in most areas. They are SHOT before things get that bad. I keep a paintball-gun loaded with red-pellets for any stray dogs. Stings enough to teach a teachable dog, and leaves a nice signal on their coat. The first time they get the paintball gun (and MAYBE a 2nd time too if they seem to be a well-mannered dog). If that doesn't teach the owner and alert them to what could have REALLY happened to their dog, then sadly nobody is learning anything -- so out comes the rifle next time their dog is seen chasing wildlife.\n\nCats aren't so easily forgiven, because from past experience I know that warning a cat-licker makes absolutely no difference whatsoever (as anyone knows who has ever tried to deal with any of them, look at this very discussion as proof of what I say).

Zero risk - no.  Marginally higher risk levels for money that has no short term requirements absolutely.  Instead of depositing money in a savings account buy the bank stock and easily double if not triple your annual rate of return just on the dividend.  Want a bit more security of capital find a perpetual preferred bank share issue and forego the capital appreciation potential.  For taxable accounts the dividend tax credit leverage the real return even higher.\n\nMarket growth GICs are another way to gain some upside potential for those fearful of the stock market.  These GICs offer the guaranteed equivalent of basic bank interest as a minimum and up to 5% annualized as a maximum.\n\nMy point was essentially that if one is truly so risk adverse as to leave $100K+ in a savings account that the maneuvers being suggested aren't likely all that palatable.

Thus, she had no support whatsoever for her claim.

Charles disliked Henry both personally and politically, and was happy to help his aunt. \n\nMore importantly, in 1527, Naples and the Papal States had a war, which the Pope lost.
